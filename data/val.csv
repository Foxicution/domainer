classkick.com,"Every day, teachers struggle to answer all of their students’ questions. Even worse, they’re often unaware of who needs help because some students are too shy to raise hands. Classkick is a free app that eliminates those roadblocks, showing teachers exactly what their students are doing and who has pressed “I need help” on a specific part of their assignment. Rather than reinvent how students learn or how teachers teach, Classkick facilitates current classroom learning. In Classkick, every student's’ handwriting, whether it’s a 2nd grader drawing a picture or an 11th grader doing physics, appears live to the teacher in a mosaic of working students. The teacher can zoom into any student’s sheet to help them and ask a probing question to redirect their thinking. By the time the student has read and thought through the feedback, the teacher has already swept off and helped 5 others. We are hyper focused on one goal: increase student learning. To achieve this, we listen to educators to truly understand how technology can assist in the learning process."

kheironmed.com,"Kheiron’s AI-powered mammography tool is designed to help radiologists detect cancer earlier. Their next-generation technology aims to increase a patient’s survival chances and pave the way for less invasive treatments. It’s a hard fact to face, but one in six people will die of cancer. Detecting cancer and tracking it accurately is challenging and time-consuming for even the most experienced radiologists. Partly, this is due to a global shortage of radiologists, but it’s also because clinicians can’t always access the right information at the right time to make confident decisions. Kheiron’s AI-driven mammography tool, Mia, can greatly improve the efficiency and effectiveness of early-stage cancer detection by identifying potentially cancerous tissue that radiologists could miss. Their AI-driven mammography tool aims to help detect cancer with accuracy comparable to or exceeding human radiologists. Kheiron aims to improve cancer survival chances by enabling earlier and potentially less invasive treatments. Mia has been tested with NHS clinicians and reviewed mammograms from over 10,000 women. Although most were cancer-free, it successfully identified all symptomatic cases, and flagged 11 instances that the doctors had overlooked."

pandai.org,"💡 What is Pandai? Pandai is an app that helps students get better grades in school. Pandai provides gamified quizzes aligned to a specific school curriculum, from which students can learn, practice, get feedback, and diagnose their weaknesses. 🔥 Why do we build this? In Southeast Asia, the education system is competitive and exam-oriented. There is a huge demand for interventions (tutors, workbooks, and extra classes) to help students perform better in school. Pandai fills the demand with a solution that is better than the alternatives. 👨‍🏫 Who We Are The three founders are based in Malaysia and have known each other since high school, 23 years ago. After we graduated (from MIT & other US colleges), we started our first education company in 2007, focusing on coaching school students in STEM subjects. We worked closely with students (many of them from underprivileged backgrounds) and saw firsthand the impact we’ve had on them. We then realized that with technology, we could reach more students and bring more impact. Hence, we released Pandai in 2020. 🚀 Present & Future Currently, we have launched in our home ground Malaysia in 2020. So far, 280,000 students have completed 83 million questions on Pandai, and 92% of users have seen some improvement in their academic performance. We plan to expand to Southeast Asia and other emerging markets, a market of 100M+ school students. Pandai is designed to be scalable, and our content (also available in English) can be mapped to other curricula from other countries."

mypetrolpump.com,"Why did we pick this idea to work on? India is a country with 200 mln vehicles (about the same number as USA) but one third the number of gas stations(60K) as compare to USA(160K), The consequence of odd number of fuel stations is long queues of vehicles at the gas stations to fill up, heavily congested Indian roads make it worse. Opening of 100K new fuel stations is practically & economically impossible in urban localities due to rocketing high land prices. And that's how the idea of mobile refueling was conceptualized by founders. Literally ""bringing the gas stations to doorsteps"". The problem of buying fuel is much more alarming in large volume consumer segments such as Vehicle fleet users like schools, cab rentals, freight logistics operators , tours and travels operators, hospitals, hotels, real estate etc who burn huge amount of dead mileage & loss of productivity while sending all fleet vehicles to gas stations to fill up. Additionally, India has a unique problem of Electricity blackouts. Current avg. is less than 18 hours of a day of electricity in Indian metro cities, which causes more than 20 mln household and commercial buildings running on backup generators which require Diesel. They cant bring the generators to gas stations either therefore they buy Diesel in jerry cans or barrels and transport unsafely. Our solution is solving the desperate & daily need of Indian consumers along with convenience. Do we have domain expertise in this area? Founder is ex veteran of Shell with 9 years of global experience, has complete understanding Oil marketing business. How do you know people need what you're making? We have over 5000 registred large volume customers who are waiting to be served. With our limited number of refueling vehicles ,we could serve max 1200 customers currently. We got all these customers without spending a penny in marketing and promotion. Zero sales efforts. Additionally, we have received over 400 franchisee requests across India where people want to offer mobile refueling service their town validating the demand."

zealth-ai.com,"Zealth is building remote monitoring software to help hospitals provide automated continuous round-the-clock support to their cancer patients post-discharge. Hospitals are overburdened with no resources to provide care to their chronic patients once they leave the hospital. For instance, in India, there are only 2200 oncologists for 1.38 billion people. Patients travel 100 miles waiting for hours to get few minutes with the doctors. They have no easy means to manage all the toxicities and symptoms they get once they are back home. This leads to 6X lower patient retention, 4X high emergency readmissions, and poor patient outcomes. Zealth bridges this gap through its digital health intervention platform."

We offer online doctor’s visits, withdrawal medication prescriptions, and support for long-term recovery, using a protocol 6x more effective than most rehabs (2/3rds of which don't have doctors). More than 3 million Americans are addicted to opioids, but 80% are not getting help, due to jobs, families, and privacy concerns. Meanwhile, there's a proven treatment that increases survival rates by 600%, and it's low cost, discreet, and convenient. It's called MAT, and it looks like treatment for anxiety or depression: medication plus therapy. However, doctors need a special waiver to prescribe the medication, which fewer than 5% of them have, so it's difficult to get, and most people are buying it on the street. Sadly, drug dealers aren't doctors: every 11 minutes another American dies of an opioid overdose, now the #1 cause of death for Americans under 50. Ophelia is replacing rehab with telemedicine, using proven science and a consumer-first approach. The opioid treatment market in the U.S. is $15B, and 85% of opioid addicts have insurance that pays for it. We're treating roughly 400 patients with thousands more waiting. Zack started Ophelia after losing his girlfriend to an opioid overdose, who found it easier to get medication from a drug dealer than a doctor. We are raising money to help patients in waiting, grow our footprint, save lives, and earn venture-level returns for investors."

cero.ai,"At Cero, we solve specific coordination tasks between hospitals and patients, such as appointment confirmations and last minute cancellations, by automatically communicating with patients over WhatsApp. For example, a patient can confirm and reschedule their appointment without needing to call anyone. Almost half of the medical appointments in Latin America are missed because patients simply do not show up. This ranges from missing a regular dentist check to missing an expensive MRI scan. With increasing pressure to improve access to care in developing countries, optimizing communication and coordination with patients is a key task to achieve. This is a massive problem especially in places where most people don't know how to effectively use self-service mediums (or are too busy to use them). We bootstrapped the company and we are profitable. As of August 2021 we have $97K in monthly revenue from 15 clients with a CMRG of 20% in the last year. We have 100% logo retention and we grow with our clients. We are currently coordinating over 600,000 medical appointments every month, just in Chile. This problem represents a $3.5B market opportunity in Latin America only. Latin America has 650M people, each one having an average of 3 medical consultations per year. We charge for every time we effectively communicate with a patient. We plan to handle several coordination interactions with every patient for each consultation, which considers a roadmap of scheduling, confirming, booking, reimbursements, payments, among others. We are a team mixing strong knowledge about the healthcare industry with deep technical skills. Felipe (CEO) is a former dentist that has led deep changes in healthcare payments in Chile. Mauricio (CTO) and Jorge (R&D), both PhD in Computer Science, led the creation of the most advanced Spanish Language Neural Network used daily by scientists and practitioners in LatAm (BETO: Spanish BERT). In a weekend project, Mauricio and Jorge automated the communication with students attending a summer school obtaining impressive engagement. Felipe was struggling with contacting his patients to coordinate appointments, and saw a big opportunity in this technology. The three together have designed and run a solution that as of 2021 is coordinating over 600,000 patients per month in their home country, Chile."

Mass produced shirts were meant to accommodate a wide variety of body types with one standard size, and different brands have different sizing standards, making shopping difficult--many men must shop in 4 - 5 different stores before finding a shirt that actually fits! By providing a home try on program and giving the ability to make custom fit adjustments to all of their apparel, Vastrm allows its customers to finally hone in on and find the perfect fit for their unique body types. Tang came up with the idea for Vastrm, which is a Sanskrit word for cloth, when a customer told him he had purchased a perfect shirt in Italy and has never been able to find the same fit again. He was considering flying back to Italy to track the shirt maker down, but Jonathan managed to adjust Vastrm shirts to the same fit."

voting.works,"VotingWorks is a non-partisan non-profit founded on the powerful idea that the operating system of our democracy should be publicly owned. Every citizen’s vote is sacred, and every citizen deserves evidence that our elections are free and fair. Forty states use voting machines that are over ten years old. Their technology is outdated, their source code proprietary and their security vulnerabilities – described in detail by the security community over many years – are left unpatched. It’s not surprising that 76% of voters are concerned that our elections are vulnerable to hacking. And if voters lose trust in elections, then the very foundation of our democracy is at risk. We’re using open-source software, off-the-shelf hardware, and modern product engineering to make elections dramatically safer, more accessible, and more affordable. Affordability may sound pedestrian, but it is key. The front line of America’s election security rests in the hands of the 50% of US counties that struggle to afford basic services, let alone upgrade aging voting equipment."

koalaops.com,"We make running services on Kubernetes as easy as Heroku, but on your cloud and with all the flexibility and power of Kubernetes. Companies use Koala so that they don't have to hire dedicated infrastructure engineers. Although 50-70% of organizations have already adopted Kubernetes, most developers agree that it is too complex and difficult to manage. It is intended to be extremely flexible in order to solve pretty much everyone’s needs, but it can take a ton of work and many auxiliary tools to get there. As companies grow, they spend a lot on DevOps or Platform Engineers that try to reduce the burden on developers by gluing together all the 3p tools via custom internal tools. We are building an “internal developer platform” out of the box, with best practices and golden paths for building and operating services on Kubernetes. We do the research on the latest and greatest tools in the extremely vibrant ecosystem, and automatically integrate for you the tools you want to use. We operate on our customers code and in your Cloud environment, so they never locked in and never restricted, as is common with classic PaaS offerings. If you prefer a fully hosted environment like Heroku, Fly or Vercel, we’ll host a cluster for you and offer you a one-click migration to your own cluster when you want."

Smoking addiction is the largest cause of preventable death and disease in the world, addicting over 1.1 billion people and killing 8 million every year. Our society has made great strides towards solving this problem, and while the majority of today’s smokers want to quit, there is one remaining barrier: today’s treatments for smoking addiction have an average failure rate of 90%. This is largely due to the terrible user experience of patches, pills, and gums, which limit patient adoption, and the very slow-acting profile of the available medications, which lead to high rates of relapse. Miist Therapeutics has developed a novel and patent-pending inhaled nicotine treatment that provides a very similar user experience to smoking and nearly instantaneous relief, reducing withdrawals and cravings within 2-5 minutes after use. This inhaled nicotine therapy gradually reduces the dose of nicotine so that by the end of treatment the patient has successfully solved both their cigarette addiction, and the underlying nicotine addiction."

Few lessons learned are shared and the industry has had no growth in labor productivity since 1947.

optimal.ag,"Optimal Agriculture provides the most advanced operating platform for greenhouses, optimizing revenue, minimizing costs and eliminating error in greenhouse management. Traditional agriculture presents a series of shortcomings: it uses 70% of the world’s fresh water, requires land (of which there’s a shortage) and requires the use of heavy amounts of pesticides. Greenhouses offer significantly more controlled growing environments. The world needs to more than double the capacity of high-tech greenhouses, but there is a shortage of skilled growers to operate them. Optimal Agriculture ’s technology allows greenhouse operators to increase their yield and the reliability of their production, whilst reducing energy consumption. This has a positive impact on the opportunity to build new greenhouses across the world and manage them efficiently and effectively, ultimately making a positive contribution to global food production and food security and the drive towards net zero emissions."

fountain9.com,"Fountain9 is a predictive inventory planning solution. We help food brands and retailers reduce food wastage and improve product availability by predicting their future inventory needs. Food wastage is a global problem that has both financial and environmental costs. An estimated $1.3 Bn tonnes of food is wasted every year and 7 - 15% of that is because of mismanaged inventory. We accurately predict future inventory imbalances which lead to out of stock situations or wastage, and also recommends best ways of minimising their impact. Our state of the art demand sensing and pricing engine takes into account several factors like historical sales trends, seasonality, holidays, markdown events and pricing changes to predict future inventory requirements and optimize prices. Predicted inventory demand is also aligned with supply side data to identify ideal suppliers and replenishment quantities that minimize chances of stock outs or inventory wastage."

blacksmith.sh,"Blacksmith helps companies run their continuous integration (CI) up to twice as fast, at half the cost. We do this by running their CI on high performance gaming CPUs. - Engineering productivity is often marred by slow CI that grows quadratically with the size of the engineering organization. - On top of this, companies pay high markups to run CI on the hyperscalers. - Consequently, companies have to run their CI on spot instances to keep costs in check. Since spot instances can get pre-empted at any point, running CI reliably on them requires [significant engineering investment](https://www.rippling.com/blog/how-rippling-used-spot-instances-to-save-and-scale-ci-cd). Blacksmith offers CI compute that is more performant, cheaper, and reliable. With Blacksmith, companies do not have to think about CI as they scale. We are starting with GitHub Actions - today's most popular and fastest-growing CI system. With a one-line change, companies can run their CI up to twice as fast on our high-performance hardware. In addition to this, Blacksmith provides colocated warm caches along with optimizations for common CI workloads (like building and pushing Docker images). Aayush, JP and Aditya have gained deep systems and product knowledge from their time at Cockroach Labs and Faire respectively. Both these companies, with several hundred engineers, were spending in the order of millions of dollars on their CI. Yet they were riddled with slow CI and actively seeking out cheaper and faster alternatives. Blacksmith offers exactly this alternative, at a time where being lean is table-stakes for most companies."

tortus.ai,"TORTUS are revolutionizing healthcare with their next generation AI co-pilot for doctors, OSLER. In today’s world, doctors spend as much time on computers as they do with patients, 4.5 hours a day, clicking the mouse 4,000 times per shift. This inefficiency costs the US $140bn a year and contributes to physician burnout and growing waiting lists. To address this challenge, TORTUS created an AI-powered computer interface for clinicians called OSLER. Acting as a co-pilot, OSLER interacts seamlessly with any medical software suite without back-end integration, taking care of tasks like note summarization, transcription, billing, and coding. OSLER saves up to 60% of physicians’ time, doubles the quality of documentation, and reduces cognitive load by 75%. As a result, patients experience shorter wait times and more personalized care. They’ve made significant progress, with two co-development partnership hospitals, signed NDAs with three EHR companies in the UK and Canada, and piloted their prototype with dozens of physicians. >50% of physicians reported they would be very disappointed to never use OSLER again. Clinicians around the world already love their solution. The CCIO at one of their co-development partner hospitals stated, “Hands down the best application of AI in healthcare delivery I’ve ever seen.” OSLER is HIPAA compliant, cyber-secure, and piloting on two continents. Their mission is to accelerate the intelligent and safe adoption of AI in healthcare for the benefit of patients, payers and clinicians alike."

chipiron.co,"Making MRIs as common and simple as blood sampling, allowing prevention and medical imaging availability at scale. MRI is medicine’s best imaging technique, producing 3D images with incredible details. Contrary to alternatives, it is non-ionizing, which makes it comparatively harmless. However, MRIs are difficult to obtain; MRIs are inaccessible to 75% of the world’s population. For those with access, the waiting time can be about 34 days on average, and use of MRIs is restricted to the most urgent cases. Chipiron develops a new detection system based on quantum detectors called SQUID. This is a cutting-edge low-noise amplification system, highly engineered magnetic shielding, and new low-field rapid sequences to reach sensitivity thresholds that have never been reached. This means that magnetic intensity is not the first driver of image quality, and current SNR can be obtained under 10mT. By doing so, a new generation of MRI devices that are no longer heavy, expensive, or cumbersome will emerge."

Now, as a team of three friends from the University of Cambridge, we’ve spent the last month combining our domain expertise in Computer Science, Machine Learning and Chemistry to develop state of the art models for reaction optimisation. Although ML is becoming well established in other fields, current chemical models generalise poorly and require lots of programming experience. We make our models easily accessible to chemists in the lab. Finding the right conditions quickly allows pharmaceutical companies to test more drugs, and finding better optima makes manufacturing process cheaper and more environmentally friendly."

However creating entirely unique voice experiences is a significant challenge as the demand for content creation grows. Typically a slow and tedious process, voice content can take years to collect and edit; this is due to frequent iteration cycles and the accompanying logistics of casting, scheduling, recording, directing, and editing. Sonantic developed a new text-to-speech tool which creates uniquely human-sounding voices that can be generated in seconds. The resulting computer-generated speech can be selected based on gender, personality, accent, tone, and emotional state. As well as dramatically reducing the pre-production phase in a voice-based feature development, the tool unlocks creative potential within wider entertainment for all projects that require quality voice, fast."

With a combination of clinical trials, non-invasive skin sampling, next-generation sequencing and state-of-the-art data science, Mitra Bio guides the design of novel skincare compounds that work directly on the human skin. As skin ages, there are characteristic changes in DNA methylation patterns. These changes are influenced by factors like UV exposure, oxidative stress, and inflammation. By analyzing DNA methylation patterns in specific genes related to skin health, one can gain insights into the biological age of the skin and its overall quality. This information can provide valuable data about skin aging, potential damage due to environmental factors, and even predict the efficacy of skincare interventions. Mitra Bio has invented an at-home test that detects the skin’s biological age, inflammation, and sun damage. Their skin diagnostics platform turns epigenetic biomarkers and data into actionable insights for intervention efficacy, dosage and rejuvenation. Mitra Bio is working closely with leading skincare companies to help them optimize the clinical success of therapeutics."

cheddar.io,"Ditch your bare-bones, high-fee checking account. You deserve free and powerful everyday banking. Nearly 3 out of 4 millennials would rather go to the dentist than listen to their bank. While it's possible that we just really love our oral hygiene, it's more likely that we don't trust or like our banks. It's not hard to understand why. Big banks use big budgets and armies of salespeople and marketers to sell old-school products layered with fees and penalties. Their profits increase when we spend more, overuse debt, and make mistakes like overdrafting. Big banks get away with this because banking is such a vital service. Everyday spending and saving decisions that begin at the checking account ultimately determine whether we'll lead a healthy and secure financial life. What can be done? Bill Gates believes banks aren't necessary for banking. Millennials believe technology companies can make banking better. So let's build a better bank. Cheddar is a new mobile bank account, debit card, and business model to free the world from underpowered checking accounts and evil banks."

It does not require a chemistry lab and can be easily tuned towards different applications, from air quality monitoring to human samples testing. Human lives, product waste and CO2 emissions could be saved if we had the ability to detect molecules digitally – and ideally outside of the lab. Once tests are performed, the interpretation of the outputs of chromatograms and mass spectrometers is highly manual. The whole process can take hours. To enable seamless digital detection of chemical compounds for the modern world, better instruments and sensors, better and bigger datasets, and better algorithms are needed. With Volatile AI’s portable gas chromatograph, detecting chemical compounds does not require a chemistry lab anymore. Multi-sensor data is then processed using AI algorithms solving for the ultimate client needs: material chemical composition control, smell profiling, and contaminant detection. Volatile AI are reducing the time needed to perform these analyses from 2-5 days (including collecting and shipping samples to a lab) to 1 hour for field testing using their device.
