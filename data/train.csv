connect.earth,"Connect Earth support financial institutions in offering their retail and business customers carbon footprint measurement solutions. Every year, trillions of financial transactions are made by consumers and businesses. Each underlying product and service represented by those transactions has a carbon footprint. The climate crisis is at its tipping point and emissions need to be mitigated. But buyers don’t have easy access to carbon footprint information to make sustainable decisions, and financial institutions don’t have access to carbon footprint data on their SME customers to measure their financed emissions. Connect Earth APIs integrate directly with banking products, enabling financial institutions to empower their retail and SME customers with carbon emissions information about their transactions. With Connect Insights, they enable financial institutions to acquire, engage, and retain climate conscious customers who are looking to measure and reduce their carbon emissions. All by providing insightful data and tailored recommendations within their banking product. With Connect Report, they empower banks to assess their financed emissions and identify green financing opportunities, while supporting SMEs on their decarbonization journey."

villagelabs.app,"At Village Labs, we help America's businesses become employee owned by helping them set up and manage an employee stock ownership plan (ESOP). ESOPs are a federal retirement plan that enable businesses to give their employees a stake in the company in exchange for significant tax benefits. With 2.9M Baby Boomer business owners set to retire in the coming years, there's a growing ""Silver Tsunami"" of businesses across the country in search of new ownership. For many of these owners, selling to their employees is a socially-minded yet financially pragmatic solution. By selling ownership of their business to an ESOP, owners get a fair price, tax benefits, and the satisfaction of knowing their employees and legacy will be taken care of — things not guaranteed with traditional buyers like private equity. In turn, employees retain their jobs and get shares in the business that can help them create life changing wealth by the time they retire — imagine an office secretary retiring as a millionaire. Thousands of businesses across America like Bob's Red Mill, Harpoon Brewery, and Recology already have an ESOP, benefiting over 14 million workers and creating 2.1 trillion in employee wealth. We're excited about the opportunity to massively grow these numbers by making it simple for every business to become employee owned."

mezmo.com,"Mezmo, formerly LogDNA, is an observability platform to manage and take action on your data. It ingests, processes, and routes log data to fuel enterprise-level application development and delivery, security, and compliance use cases. Mezmo was brought to life by three-time co-founders Chris Nguyen and Lee Liu and included in the Winter 2015 batch of Y Combinator. In 2018 the company partnered with tech giant, IBM, to become the sole logging provider for IBM Cloud. Mezmo is on a mission to empower people who build solutions that shape the world. We’re doing this by delivering a platform that enables enterprises to get more value from their observability data in real time, regardless of source, destination, use case, or scale. We’re not the only ones working on this problem but we have a few things the others don’t. We’re cloud-native and know how to make the most of modern technology like Kubernetes. We have scaled a solution from zero to petabyte scale in a short amount of time, while supporting thousands of active users across multiple environments. We are hungry for change and are surrounded by enterprises telling us they’re hungry, too. We have a kick-ass group of people who are thinking about the problem analytically and are excited to change the observability world for the better. Mezmo has helped some of the world’s most innovative companies transform how they manage their systems and applications. Still, we know that we can help them get more value from their observability data by providing more flexibility and control over how they use it. This will enable teams to spend less time switching between data silos so they can focus on shipping better, more resilient, and secure products. We have momentum on our side. Last year we saw triple digit revenue growth and added 800 new customers to our roster. Recent accolades include being named to YC’s Top Companies, CRN’s 10 Hottest DevOps Startups, and EMA’s Top 3 Observability Platforms."

dropprintgen.com,"Who we are? We write software that understands the activity of individual cells as opposed to all cells. This approach is novel because we are no longer looking at average signals and can be precise. It is like a police person trying to identify the speeding car, they won’t find it if they look at all the cars at once, rather they need to look at the speed of each individual car. This is the beauty of single cell genomics, we can now identify that speeding car. Why now? The biggest barrier for entry into the single cell genomics market are cost and data analysis. To that end, we have reduced the cost by 10-fold and built the computational infrastructure for scalability. Although single cell sequencing has only been around for about five years, we come from one of the top single cell genomics labs and were the first to process and analyze millions of immune cells. Thanks to our software solutions, we have been able to bring big data solutions to the immune system. Where are we and where are we going? We have generated a database of over 1 million immune cells spanning healthy, cancerous, and autoimmune immune cells and are growing through paid partnerships. Harnessing out database and ML software, we can take a data-centric approach for better target discovery. Fortunately, as our database continues to grow, our models will continue to learn for more precise, unbiased, and automated single cell genomics. Thank you!"

accurx.com,"Accurx helps to create a more joined-up healthcare system, where everyone involved in a patient’s care can communicate with each other to deliver better care.Today, over 98% of GPs in England use Accurx. Through the Covid-19 pandemic they helped 30 million people get the vaccinations they needed. Just one patient in the NHS system requires a huge amount of system coordination from all the professionals providing their care. Whether speaking to a patient, coordinating care across services, making patient referrals or asking second opinions, healthcare staff spend countless hours communicating day to day. For decades, NHS staff have had to rely on legacy systems and siloed channels to manage patient care. This all results in communication breakdown, with overstretched staff and suffering patient care. Accurx helps doctors and patients communicate with simple and fast technology. Through one platform everyone involved in the patient’s care has a space for discussion and sharing information. It’s quicker and more efficient than the current mix of letters, phones and pagers found in the NHS. And it has the power to transform the stories of patients for the better."

If you are a lawyer working in solo or small practice, we encourage you to find a more effective way to grow your law practice. We also encourage you not to take our word for it.

neptune-robotics.com,"Using their unique magnetic crawler technology, Neptune Robotics enables both above and underwater ship cleaning. They are on a mission to reduce the carbon footprint and fuel consumption of shipping. Every year, $960 billion is spent on fuel consumption by global merchant ships. Around 18% of the fuel is used to fight resistance caused by bio-mass grown on the ship hull. The term specifically refers to a build-up of microorganisms and other life. That includes a wide range of different creatures, like algae and barnacles. The current solution is to send divers down to inspect and clean the ship hull. This contaminates waters, harms marine life, and is banned in the majority of ports. Neptune’s self-developed and manufactured intelligent robot can conduct an above and underwater hull clean. They map a dynamic path planning in 3D space – above and below water – as well as automatic cleaning operations through its underwater positioning system, precise displacement projection, real-time robot pose capture, 3D map heuristic generation, and massive real-time data cloud computing and monitoring."

Matt and Steph are leveraging their experience from the self-driving industry, where we've integrated high-performance computing and quality sensing into complex, noise-filled environments. We focus on robust hardware and user-friendly software for a new generation of end-users, ensuring ease of use and rapid deployment. Secure and efficient handling of user data can make customers in the manufacturing space nervous to invest in sensing — our team's extensive experience handling self-driving car data in these regulated environments positions us uniquely to tackle these challenges. Companies like Keyence, National Instruments, and FLIR offer either outdated hardware or prohibitively expensive systems, along with software that hasn’t evolved to meet modern user needs. US manufacturing is undergoing a significant transformation, with construction spending hitting a record annualized pace of over $200 billion. The need for a more reliable supply chain has seen over $700 billion in manufacturing megaprojects across North America since 2021, and this growth requires heavy automation.

We deliver care by creating a specialized workforce to provide targeted psychotherapy, medication management + genetic testing, coaching, and holistic wellness. LunaJoy utilizes technology and data science to provide intelligent touchpoints that decrease costs and accelerate outcomes. We are increasing our in-network footprint to provide truly accessible care for all. Women are twice as likely to experience mental health difficulties. Rates are even higher for women of color and LGBTQ+ folks. Women are 3x more likely to experience sexual, physical, emotional trauma which is a predictor for mental illness. This is just the tip of the iceberg! Physiologically, women experience hormonal fluctuations which make them more vulnerable to mental health issues during times of transition such as puberty, pregnancy, postpartum, and menopause. We also face unique stressors as the emotional bedrock of our homes, supporting young families, elderly adults, and a huge part of the workforce. The downstream effects of this gap in care are far-reaching into our ecosystems. Currently, mental health care is expensive, inconvenient, and generalist where a specialized approach is needed. When we attend to women’s mental health, we all shine brighter!"

Traditionally, it has been the women’s financial and health burden to have a contraceptive in place. Our first goal is therefore to bring a novel non-hormonal, on-demand and low cost female contraceptive to the market that will substantially improve their quality of life and well-being. Our second goal is to develop the first ever non-surgical and highly effective non-hormonal contraceptive for men. Currently, male contraception is limited to two main options – vasectomy or condoms. Having such options available to both women and men will globally allow for much better family planning, reduce the number of unwanted pregnancies including abortions and therefore reduce costs and ensure contraceptive health and well-being."

There are 2.2B overweight people and 500M people with type 2 diabetes worldwide, and these numbers increase drastically every year. Existing drugs are not effective enough to reverse the trend. Our drug can solve this problem, because it addresses the root cause of metabolic disorders – the imbalance between caloric intake and expenditure. Our drug will target mitochondria – the powerhouse of the cell – to generate heat. This approach has been proven to fully reverse obesity and type 2 diabetes in animals. However, therapeutic application for humans was impossible, because mitochondrial heat production could only be induced by highly artificial methods with side effects. This changed after our recent breakthrough discovery of the protein that mitochondria naturally use to generate heat. We have developed a unique high-throughput drug discovery platform to identify compounds that selectively activate this target protein, without side effects. For decades people have wanted a drug that burns calories like exercise does. We are realizing this dream at Equator Therapeutics."

Tone of voice is what makes a brand’s content unique, and no brand has found a way to transform this subjective concept into a hard set of editorial guidelines to follow. This results in a long and painful collaboration process between tools and teams to approve content before release. This means that even with Generative AI’s breakthrough, brands will continue to rely on human copywriters as the gatekeepers of tone of voice, needing to review every single piece of content before release. Newtone is building the first AI-powered platform capable of actually scaling branded content. They have developed a proprietary algorithm based on automated prompt learning. With very little brand data (newsletters, blogs etc), they are able to capture a brand’s tone of voice, translate it into a robust prompt to feed the AI, and perfectly replicate any brand’s writing style in seconds. Newtone actually unlocks the power of Generative AI for brands. In just 3 months, their smart-content writer is being used by 14 customer brands, 20 brands sit on their waitlist and they have secured a design partnership with a $4bn marketplace."

Previous attempts at drive-thru voice ordering are costly to implement and have failed to deliver the accuracy and latency needed. It's now possible to build a voice interface that passes the threshold for a great customer experience. In the United States, there are 200,000 Drive-Thrus handling 6 Billion visits a year. At 3 minutes per order, that's 34,000 human years spent on taking orders annually. Per location, on average we can deliver around $100,000 of value in terms of labor savings, upsell revenue lift, and training costs."

letsrecover.com,"Recover provides more effective and affordable addiction treatment via telemedicine. We partner with local governments to save lives and taxpayer dollars. More than 20 million Americans struggle with addiction, but less than 10% of people who need it receive treatment. For those that do, it usually does not work - only 8% get better. Most of this treatment is funded by governments, and goes to programs that are frequently predatory, and focus more on profit than people. We have created an effective, accessible, and affordable solution: Recover. We offer a proven approach using medication and counseling, that can improve outcomes for over 70% of patients. It reduces overdoses by 80%, death by 50%, and has years of research and application showing it works. Despite how effective this medication can be, most rehabs do not have medical professionals on staff. Not only does our program work better and bring medicine to addiction care, it also costs just 10% of traditional programs. Nick founded Recover after seeing his family and friends struggle with addiction. He was raised by a drug addict, has an alcoholic brother, and lost an uncle to heroin. He saw how hard it is for people to get the treatment they need, and how ineffective existing options are. We are working to make sure that people like Nick’s family have access to best-in-class addiction treatment so they can get and stay well."

fogbender.com,"Fogbender helps B2B companies support customer teams: think Intercom meets Slack's shared channels. Today, all customer software is explicitly or implicitly designed for helping individuals, not teams. This is forcing B2B companies - who sell products to teams, not individuals - to augment their default customer support platform (Zendesk, Intercom, Front, etc) with a second, ""unofficial"", system: Slack's shared channels. This causes a number of operational and logistical difficulties for both vendors and their customers, resulting in added costs, inefficiencies, and lost opportunities. With Fogbender, B2B vendors embed a team-to-team messaging widget directly on their customer dashboard, where all users belonging to an account can - with no additional authentication - 1) see a list of currently-open issues 2) participate in conversations with their own team and the vendor, and 3) search all historical discussions."

phagos.org,"Phagos uses bacteria’s biological predator – the bacteriophage – to overcome the silent pandemic of antibiotic resistance. Bacteria cause deadly infections, and antibiotics have historically been the key to fight them. But now, bacteria are evolving and developing antibiotics resistance, mostly due to the overuse of antibiotics in the livestock industry. The WHO describes this phenomenon as a global health crisis. In 2019 alone, antibiotic resistance killed 1.3 million people. That’s as much as the total COVID-19 death toll in the EU. Experts project that by 2050 antibiotic resistance could surpass cancer as a leading cause of death, and cost the world 100 trillion dollars. Bacteria have a natural predator who has been hunting them down with tremendous efficiency for billions of years, and has been evolving to counter bacterial evolution: the bacteriophage. Taking advantage of the adaptive capacity of the bacteriophage, Phagos has developed a platform to produce personalised pharmaceuticals 10 times faster than the state of the art. With clinical trials showing up to 90% increases in chances of survival, the company is gearing up for commercialisation. Phagos’ first target is the biggest consumer of antibiotics in the world: animals."

bbymilk.com,"BBy's condensing device turns milk into a fine powder that spares the biome leaving it biologically and immunologically active. This allows hospitals to stop wasting precious nursing time defrosting milk for hours and milk wastage from discarding rules. Simply weigh the powder, add water, shake and serve. No more freezing, no more defrosting, only patient care. NICUs are time sensitive wards in the hospital, time is everything and yet nurses today continue to prepare frozen milk for infants in what's known as the milk shift. A shift where the nurse spends the day defrosting milk for the next shift of nurses. Our tech is now fully peer reviewed and published, yielding safe and reliable results in over 20 hospitals in the New York Tri-State. The company is headed by Vansh Langer MD, a physician (Windsor University, University of Chicago) and Blanca Aguilar Uscanga PhD, a Bioengineering/Food Science PhD (University of Guadalajara /Centro Universitario de Ciencias Exactas e Ingenierías (CUCEI)) team that has over 50 published works in the field between them and are experts in the science of infant nutrition.

bountiful.ag,"We’re on a mission to optimize the agricultural industry. When we started Bountiful in 2015, the grape error rate for predicting production was 30 percent. Why? We found that many farmers in the specialty crops space were still using traditional pencil-and-paper techniques to predict yield. These low-fidelity forecasting methods weren’t giving them a clear enough understanding of their production until it was too late, leading to waste and inefficiency throughout the supply chain. We saw a problem we wanted to solve. Today, Bountiful is using advanced data science to help farmers forecast more accurately, so they can make better decisions. In the last three years, we’ve combined the latest in machine learning with weather, satellite, geographic, and historical data. The result is a user-friendly platform that transforms volumes of complex agricultural information into simple, actionable insights farmers can use to run more economically and environmentally sustainable farms. More recently, we’re working to open the dialogue between buyers and sellers, remove uncertainty, and provide clarity to the supply chain to meet global food demand. Our ultimate goal is to close the agricultural margin of error. Not only will this make individual farms more efficient, profitable, and sustainable, but it will help optimize the global food supply chain. That means healthier people and a healthier planet."

Yet, 95% of clinics still outsource their routine blood tests leading to lengthy turnaround times while costing patients time, money, and delayed prognosis. The present diagnostics system severely overlooks the urgency and frequency required when treating women’s health, creating a demand for prompt management of women’s health problems. Haemetrics is building a proprietary, automated, on-site testing platform to comprehensively analyse female health-associated hormones from blood to make diagnostics simpler, affordable, and at the point of care. Haemetrics’ mission is to equip clinics with their state-of-art device to enable informed and timely decision-making. Their goal is to create clinician and patient-centric diagnostics and make modern healthcare accessible to clinics of all sizes. This is their first step towards creating an entry point, covering clinical and operational functions in healthcare delivery for all women from menarche to menopause."

osmind.org,"Osmind is the premier platform for clinicians and researchers advancing new life-saving mental health treatments. Today, mental health disorders are one of the leading causes of death worldwide, especially among young adults, and are tied to shortening lifespans. While there have been developments in new psychiatric medications since the first FDA approval in 1954, today there is a growing movement among clinicians, patients, and researchers who are recognizing the need to accelerate new science. The Osmind treatment platform is the first and only solution that solves specific challenges faced by neuropsychiatric clinics, spanning general psychiatry and interventional psychiatry (transcranial magnetic stimulation, ketamine, SPRAVATO®, psychedelic medicine, electroconvulsive therapy). The core electronic health record (EHR) technology is precisely developed for interventional treatment workflows and designed to support a strong therapeutic alliance, including journaling tools and assistance with health plan reimbursement, which is a significant access hurdle for millions of patients. Research from our platform is already helping to set new standards for mental health interventions. For example, in the largest published real-world analysis of ketamine infusion therapy for depression, we teamed up with Stanford University School of Medicine to share findings in the Journal of Affective Disorders (March 2022). We have multiple ongoing research studies leveraging our proprietary real-world data, including an even larger ketamine analysis leveraging machine learning to predict treatment outcomes. Osmind is a San Francisco–based public benefit corporation led by scientists, technologists, and psychiatrists. We are backed by top investors including DFJ Growth, General Catalyst, Future Ventures, Tiger Global, and Y Combinator."

Yo is a three-time-acquired serial entrepreneur with a McKinsey background. Misato is a previous head of R&D at Mercari. Tailor is the first YC company fully based in Japan. **The Problem** In today's business world, old ERP systems just don't keep up. Their monolithic architecture makes it difficult for developers to tailor to the specific needs, even though that's what the enterprises want for ERP. At the same time, legacy ERPs struggle to work well with the variety of cloud-based tools that modern businesses rely on. Legacy, monolithic systems make it very difficult to customize and hard to integrate. Every time the company wants to change something, it becomes a huge project. Building on these challenges, users of old ERP systems often face: * Hard-to-Use Interfaces: The screens and menus are old school... confusing, slowing down your work. * Wrong Set of Features: Too many unnecessary options for you and not enough of what you actually need. * Lack of Transparency: It's tough to understand what's happening behind the scenes. * High Cost: The expense of maintaining these systems eats into your budget. **The Solution** Why Headless? - With our headless product, the frontend is easy to customize for clients - API-first approach makes it easy to connect with other existing systems or 3rd party services What does it mean to our clients? - Faster development - Reduced maintenance cost - Well-documented backend APIs Tailor’s key capabilities: - GraphQL endpoint for flexible frontend development - Customizable data model templates to describe complex business logic of large enterprises - Customizable workflows depending on the client's specific business process - Directory service that can reflect complex organizational structure (e.g. matrix organization) to the workflow"

The business demands on web visual media can blindside even the most hyper-aware content teams and developers.

Next-level imaging concerns like copyright, licensing, accessibility, moderation, illegal or explicit content, ""fake news"", and more, can threaten your business at any moment if not handled properly. Get any of these things wrong and you are shedding revenue, ceding ground to competitors, and potentially exposing your business to extreme liability. By working with imgix's powerful APIs, SDKs, user interfaces, and integrations, you can rest assured that any demands on your images and videos will always be met, now and into the future, without you having to invest in building it yourself or patching together a mishmash of open source and third-party technologies.

hypermile.ai,"Hypermile is on a mission to improve trucking efficiency, sustainability and safety by developing an AI driver assistance system 🚛 🌎🌱. Today, fuel is the main cost component for logistics operators, accounting for >1/3 of all operating costs. Driving behavior is a key factor affecting overall fuel consumption and can increase fuel use by up to 35%. However, current solutions are not cost effective, so logistics operators are constantly looking for new solutions. In addition, logistics operators are under huge sustainability pressure, as Heavy Goods Vehicles (HGVs) are responsible for 16% of the UK's transport emissions but only 5% of the miles travelled. While electric vehicle sales for passenger vehicles are on the rise, the same can't be said for long-haul HGVs due to high initial cost and limited range, making it impractical for logistic purposes. With this problem in mind, we aim to leverage the latest AI techniques to improve the fuel efficiency of diesel trucks today, and increase the range of zero-emission trucks of the future. Our product Hypermile Co-Pilot is a retrofittable AI cruise control for commercial vehicles focused on controlling the speed of the truck efficiently. We have trained the AI algorithms to learn the best techniques for saving fuel: anticipating how traffic flow will change, optimising speed based on the road gradient and maximizing vehicle coasting. As a result, we can reduce diesel consumption by 11% and extend the range of battery-electric vehicles by 15%. The long term vision is to incrementally build higher levels of autonomy with the next milestone being a Level-3 autonomous trucking solution. The company was founded in May 2020 and raised a $1.5M pre-seed round in May 2021 from Y Combinator, Greg Brockman (CTO of OpenAI), Luc Vincent (former Executive VP of Autonomous Driving at Lyft Level 5) and others. We’ve received a number of R&D grants from Innovate UK, Department for Transport and Horizons 2020. We’re currently a team of 10 across Commercial, Product and Engineering (including 4. sub-teams cloud software, machine learning, automotive software and electronics)."

fitfu.com,"It all began in January 2009 when our founders - wandering digital sage Jof and software guru Benjie - released an innocent little app called PushupFu. The result of countless sleepless nights, numerous rolls of duct tape, a few everyday household objects, far too many takeouts and some epic battles with a kitten... it was released into an unsuspecting world at the entirely inappropriate time of 2am on New Year's Eve. Soon one app become four, and before we knew it we had lots of happy users and lots of great coverage by all sorts of people such The Telegraph, Wired, O'Reilly and MacFormat. Being a friendly bunch, we took the time to chat with the hundreds of you who said hello, and we found you all had the same problem: gyms were either too expensive, too daunting, too boring or too inconvenient. In other words, a lot of people needed another way to stay active. And the more people we spoke to, the bigger this problem seemed to be - it was like almost no one was active enough! Big problems require big solutions, so after raising some money from the visionaries at 4iP we amassed a team of the best designers, artists, 3d animators and programmers with the single mission: to improve the fu of the world by making an app so damn good that everyone will want to stay active. Fitfu allows you to: * Track your motion Using the accelerometer on your iPhone or iPod Touch, FitFu gives you feedback to help you keep going and reach your goals. * Celebrate progress with friends Friends are the key to sticking to your goals, so we've made FitFu social; whether you want to cheer them on, thank them for help or just compare your progress. * Discover a new way to stay motivated The more you and your friends are active, the higher your level and the higher your points. And points mean prizes; unlock new content as you progress. * Stay active wherever, whenever No more being tied to a games console or a gym, now you can stay active wherever you are - be that your bedroom, your office, a hotel room or in the cabin of your Mississippi boat. (Yes it happens!) *Lose what you want Participate with Fitfu at your level of interest - decide to be gung ho, middle of the road, or simply casual."

thinksono.com,"ThinkSono enables any healthcare professional to perform point-of-care Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT) ultrasound scans, via real-time AI-guidance, training and expert feedback. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT) is a condition in which blood clots develop within the deep veins of the leg. This can be potentially fatal if parts of the clots break off, travel through the body and become lodged in the lungs, what is called a pulmonary embolism (PE). While DVT and PE combined are the number one cause of preventable hospital death, the current diagnostic pathway is slow and inefficient. Patients often wait hours or days for test results. The ThinkSono Guidance technology leverages AI to enable non-ultrasound trained healthcare professionals to collect DVT exam data for a qualified clinician to review. This can improve the clinical pathway significantly, potentially allowing for quicker, accurate and cost-effective DVT detection compared to traditional methods."

Having been business owners ourselves, we experienced firsthand the struggles of funding a business - from expensive equity options to loans that required personal guarantees. We went live in Singapore first to validate the product/market fit. We plan to expand across the APAC region.. Our sweet spot is backing repeatable business spend - expenses that leads to increased revenue. Our financing product allows businesses to keep growing with us over time. Over a third of our advances today are from repeat borrowers. We created a brand new asset class in Asia - offering flexible repayment options, such as tieing repayment with sales. Business owners LOVE this. Our automated financial technology platform ingests revenue and alternative data sources that gives us a proprietary edge in understanding the behavior of our borrowers.

At Booktrope we do not charge authors to publish nor do we accept all submissions. We have pioneered a concept called “Team Publishing” which addresses the way books are actually developed, not just the way they are distributed and read. We offer print, ebook, and web versions of all our books, in other words, we are format agnostic. We don’t want to debate the death of print books, or the birth of ebooks, we love and support them all. A typical Publishing Team consists of an author, editor, designer and business/marketing manager for the book. You don’t get assigned projects in our system; you choose the people you work with. We work much more quickly than traditional publishers, taking advantage of new technologies to streamline the process of getting books into the hands of readers. Lastly, we use that same technology to keep overhead low, and we think that the bulk of the revenue from book sales should go back to the creative team that makes them happen."

Our Technology and Approach We have invented a suite of breakthrough 3D bioprinting technologies, featured on the cover of Science, that can build human tissue with complex blood vessel networks. We are leveraging this technology in the short term to build patient-specific tissues for drug safety and efficacy testing. Patient cells are taken from a biopsy, added to our proprietary 3D printed tissues, and then drug compounds are injected through the blood vessel network to mimic actual drug delivery in humans. Our vision is that our technology will provide rigorous, reproducible, and predictive outcomes for patients, resulting in drastically improved outcomes for diseases like cancer. More broadly, we see the full potential of our mission as being able to produce functional tissue and organ replacements for diseased or damaged vital organs in the body such as the lung, liver, pancreas, kidney, and heart."

launchpadtoys.com,"We're creating digital toys and tools that empower kids to create, learn & share their ideas through play. Give a young child a couple of toys or a box of crayons and he or she is likely to play for hours, deeply engrossed in an imaginary world. In both art and dramatic play, children construct settings, create fictional characters, and act out fantastic storylines that would be the envy of many Hollywood scriptwriters. Yet, ask that same child to write out a story in a blank notebook or a word processor and you would be lucky to capture a fraction of the depth and splendor of his or her imagination. Play inspires and scaffolds the creative process from an early age, but there is a persistent gap between the origins of imaginative play (ages 4-5) and kids' adoption of the formal discipline of creative writing (ages 8-10). At Launchpad Toys, we're using mobile devices like the iPad to bridge this gap between informal and formal learning, to harness the power of play to help children capture and share their ideas with other kids around the world. Our first product, Toontastic an app for the iPad, is a creative learning tool that blends constructionist and social development theories to empower young children to create, learn, and share their ideas through play."

In 2019, chronic liver disease was the cause of over 297,000 deaths in Europe, 3% of all deaths in the region. Liver stress is at the heart of several cardiometabolic diseases, and can increase risk of heart attack, stroke and diabetes. Without effective therapies, the only resort for many patients remains a liver transplant. However the supply of healthy donor organs cannot meet demand, and minorities are disproportionately disadvantaged. Ochre Bio is working to improve the viability of donor livers. Their solution reprogrammes the liver and tests RNA therapies on those that are discarded due to fatty liver disease. Donor livers can be kept alive outside the body for multiple days, allowing Ochre Bio to conduct extensive testing in the search for a wider set of treatments. They have uncovered hundreds of novel potential liver targets that are currently being validated in their labs."

We are building a computational-experimental platform to design therapeutics that can target several disease-causing proteins at once.

Better Dairy uses synthetic biology and precision fermentation to produce dairy products, following a similar process to brewing beer. Their products, molecularly identical to dairy but 100% animal-free, replicate the taste and texture of traditional dairy cheese, and seamlessly integrate into dairy supply chains and recipes. With 95% less greenhouse gas emissions and 90% less water consumption than traditional dairy production, Better Dairy is paving the way for a healthier dairy future that benefits both us and the planet."

Today, healthcare providers in the US are leaving up to 20% of their profit margins on the table due to subpar patient billing and collections processes. Billing patients and collecting their payments is a complex process that requires specialized skills and a lot of effort. Traditionally, healthcare providers have done this manually, with limited automation around one-way reminders. This leads to limited engagement with payers and subpar collection results. Argovox changes this by making new levels of payer engagement possible at scale. Through both voice and text conversations, our AI agents can engage in complex, multi-turn patient billing and collection conversation. This leads higher engagement with payers and optimal collection results."

qvin.com,"Qvin is the first and only healthcare service to scientifically prove menstrual blood can test for critical health information – just like a traditional laboratory blood test. Women's health has always been under-prioritized in science. We still operate in a world built by men, for men. It’s why in 2014, Dr. Sara Naseri and Søren Therkelsen started Qvin to research, develop, and patent a product that powers an underserved and understudied population—women. Over 70% of the decisions our doctors make are influenced by blood test results. Every month, 1.8 billion people across the world menstruate. However, the blood our bodies naturally deliver every month has never been explored as a testing source. And yet, menstrual blood has been left unexplored. Qvin is the first and only healthcare service to use period blood as a non-invasive blood test. We exist to give women an easy, insightful way to monitor existing health issues, proactively screen for others, and go into doctor visits more informed and confident of their own health. Our health technology platform helps women manage their health better through a non-invasive blood collection device named the Q-Pad™. All of us at Qvin want to move the study of women forward. We want to close the gender data gap. And we stand for every person who identifies with women, however they define it."

As video streaming continues to become more mainstream and the streams themselves become HD and 4K, traditional CDNs struggle to deliver high quality viewing experiences.

Not only is this expensive, but it's also inefficient, which is why at Peer5, we've created a P2P CDN to boost your video streaming capabilities. Our CDN works with your servers to ensure that as your viewership increases, your network gets stronger by offloading bandwidth to our peer network. On average, this has been shown to increase server capacity by 20x, offload 70% of bandwidth, increase viewing time by 30% and decrease instances of rebuffering by 40%. Our video streaming CDN uses emerging technologies, including HTML5 and WebRTC. They require no installation by end users and offer easy integration for content providers.

We are experts in LLMs, having scaled LLMs to 1000s of users in 2023. That's when we saw the massive drawbacks of closed-source LLMs in production, making us start Pipeshift. We met 6 years back as roommates during undergrad, and before starting Pipeshift, we led a defense robotics non-profit backed by NVIDIA and built a health-tech startup. The shift to AI is like the shift to the cloud, every company is going to implement AI. And, open-source AI will be as good as closed-source AI. Meta's Llama 3.1 models prove that.

WHO: We partner with chip manufacturing, enterprise IT, and software product development teams. WHY: Traditionally, these teams spend millions and wait months (sometimes years) to understand their complex technology infrastructure well enough to build on top of it. THE DRIVER DIFFERENCE: Instead, Driver AI is a tool that explains complex codebases in minutes vs. months. This enables teams to rapidly accelerate the technical discovery process and save significant resources.

modoo-med.com,"We build wearable fetal health monitors. As parents, we want to know more about our babies. But it’s hard to believe that, despite all the technology available, we still do not know our baby without a visit to the doctor or hospitals. Which is time consuming, expensive, and stressful. That’s why we created Modoo. Mothers simply wear the device on their belly. It tracks baby’s heart rate, movements and generates baby’s health report, so we can consult a physician with just one click. Modoo connects to an app that allows users to share data via social media sites like WeChat and Weibo, which makes it easy to help family and friends feel more connected. And thanks to the information it collects, our users reported that, it has helped preventing the loss of 73 babies so far. We has been selling Modoo in China at price of 200 dollars since 2017. last year, we tripled our revenue to 3.4 million dollars. To target at a bigger market, we launched a subscription trial 3 months ago, with an initial price of 60 dollars. It’s growing 69% week on week, and already generating 50 thousand dollars in MRR. Pregnancy is a lucrative market. 16 million babies are born in China every year, that’s a $3.2 billion dollars home market. Worldwide 140 million births make a 28 billion dollars market. About us, Jiliang is the no.1 employee in an AI startup backed by Google & Sequoia. Ying, the CTO has over 20 years experience in mobile tech with some of the world’s leading companies. To sum up, we are Modoo, the wearable fetal heath monitor company. We tripled our revenue to 3.4 million dollars in 2018. And are testing subscription model with 69% weekly growth. We started in China with a 3.2 billion market and is unlocking a 28B dollars market worldwide."
rmfg.com,"We're building autonomous sheet metal factories. Sheet metal is a large ($200b+ in the US) industry heavily reliant on human labor. If you're building something in the real world, it's almost a certainty that you will use sheet metal in some capacity. It's used in automotive manufacturing, aerospace, consumer goods, defense, and many more verticals. The industry mostly operates the same way it has for the last 50+ years. We're making a 10x better experience for people to get sheet metal parts manufactured. We are vertically integrated and build everything from our quoting engine to the physical automation inside of our factory. Factories should own automation as a core in-house skill. Today we sell laser cut and bent sheet metal parts. Users can get instant quotes through our website (and eventually through integrations build on top of our API). We build custom internal software to command and control the operations of the factory. Right now we are actively working on fully automating the production of laser cut parts including scheduling, material movement, laser configuration, etc. Orders will be able to come in, and our software will control the factory and output parts ready to ship."

ancana.co,"With Ancana, you can own a 1/4 or 1/8 share of the home and split expenses with the other co-owners. If you buy a 1/4 share of a home, you have access to it for 3 months of the year. For each property we set up the investment trust, find qualified co-owners, and handle the entire real estate purchase transaction. Costs are split amongst the co-owners, and we take care of the furnishing and ongoing property management. We accomplish this by creating an investment trust for each property and dividing it into individual, purchasable shares that represent ownership in the property. We furnish each home and find and vet the co-owners. Once all of the shares of the property are sold, we retain no ownership stake in the property and transition into the role of property manager, ensuring the home is well maintained and handling any issues that arise. Unlike a timeshare, Ancana owners own a real asset (the property) versus a block of time. If you decide you want to sell your share, you are free to do so at any time, either through us or on the open market, and capture any appreciation the property has accrued."

While the Lottie format, a JSON-based animation format, has seen significant growth since it was first developed in 2017, it managed this with no dedicated design tools. With LottieLab, users can create, collaborate on, manage and deploy animation assets across their websites and apps faster and easier than ever before. Customers can access all the benefits of code-based animations, particularly performance and interactivity, without needing to actually code them. LottieLab enables product teams to manage the entire animation process in a central platform, and to collaborate across development and deployment."

eatorigin.com,"Origin built a kiosk for offices that lets employees buy pre-packed pods from a freezer, and make them into fresh juice smoothies silently in 30 seconds. It works similar to a Keurig coffee machine, but Origin thinks it can use its smoothie maker as a Trojan horse to sell more food and other items inside the 188,000 offices in the US. Right now it earns a 56% margin on the $2.99 pods, recoups the kiosk cost in 7 weeks, and now has $30,000 in monthly recurring revenue as it grows 50% weekly. Fellow juice maker startup Juicero has run into slow demand for its expensive machine and juice subscriptions. But Origin’s in-office commerce model and cheaper pods could have a different fate if the juice tastes right."

fiber.ai,"Fiber AI automates SDR and BDR prospecting & outbound sales workflows using AI. Enterprises choose our AI sales platform because we automatically find prospects, research them, and hyper-personalize outbound messages that get 80% open rates, which is 4x the industry standard (our AISDR / AIBDR platform 2-4x's the reply rates you are currently getting). Our AI sales platform consists of 3 core components: First, Fiber AI manages domain and email health to achieve 80% open rates. We configure cold email infrastructure to maximize email deliverability. Our product will automatically configure your DNS records, warm up your emails (email warmup), orchestrate emails to send optimally across all your accounts, run multi-layer email bounce detection (email waterfall), and modify each outgoing cold outreach to ensure your cold outbound sales emails don't trigger spam filters. Second, we automate sales lead generation with dynamic audiences (AI powered sales assistant, AI based SDR). We have B2B company data on 60 million B2B companies and 800 million B2B contacts, sourced from dozens of data providers (i.e. think sources like BuiltWith, Crunchbase, LinkedIn, ZoomInfo, SemRush, Apollo data, and more). This allows you to precisely segment your audience by the companies you care about and exclude everyone else. Our audiences are dynamic (i.e., account based marketing, account based sales, ABM), meaning we continuously look for prospects matching your targeting criteria and add them to your audience to run our automated outbound sales sequences. This automates manual workflows you might be running on platforms like Clay or Persana. You can also create an audience once based on intent signals (i.e., GTM or go-to-market signals, sales intelligence) and put your outreach on autopilot. Lastly, our AI sales copilot (AI sales agent, AI based BDR) enables AI powered hyper-personalized emails that boost response rates. The biggest debate in sales is choosing between relevancy and personalization—now you don’t have to. We search far and wide to find the “golden nugget” of information to connect with your prospect, and then use GPT-4 to write hyper personalized email sequences that dramatically increase reply rates and book meetings. Because of these core differences, we stand out from competitors. Products like apollo io have poor email deliverability rates that ruin email health long-term. Existing email outbound tools like amplemarket, reply io, marketo, and outreach io don't scale well and restrict you to small volumes of outbound emails. AI features to autopilot campaigns are missing in products like smartlead ai, instantly, unify gtm, penguin ai, and warmly ai. Currently, our philosophy is to allow AI to 100-1000x your team's output while maintaining extremely high email quality. AI sales copilots like reggie ai, aisdr, artisan ai / artisan sdr / artisan bdr, and others let gpt use AI to generate the entire email, which results in poor outbound email quality since SDRs/BDRs don't have fine-tune controls on the personalization."

atomicalchemy.us,"Atomic Alchemy is building a bank of reactors to produce the nuclear material that goes into nuclear medicine. Radiopharmaceuticals are vitally important in biological tracers, diagnostic imaging, and cancer treatments. Currently, the world's supply of Molybdenum-99, the cornerstone of 80% of all nuclear medicine procedures, is sourced from just six government-run, scientific research reactors abroad. Five of these reactors are 45-65 years old and are quickly coming to the end of their operational life. This has cultivated a fragile and lengthy supply chain, at odds with the nature of radioactive material. This issue and its implications do not just effect molybdenum, but any other reactor-based isotope. Many promising cancer therapies are stuck in clinical trials, unable to secure enough material in a timely manner. Research doesn’t even happen because of the difficulty of sourcing any new isotopes. It doesn't have to be this way. Atomic Alchemy is working to solve this by building the world's first scalable radioisotope production facility. This facility will contain the world’s first privately-owned nuclear reactors dedicated to radioisotope production."

seaflight.tech,"Seaflight Technologies has developed a new form of Aerodynamic Flow Control for electrified aircraft that increases range and payload by 30%. That's the same performance improvement you'd get from hopping in a DeLorean to 2035 and coming back with batteries from the future. But it's available today - our tech has been derisked by testing supported by the National Science Foundation, the US Air Force, and the Australian Government. Our first product is a simple fixed-wing large cargo drone that is efficient enough to remove the ""green penalty"" currently associated with electric aviation. That's a step change from today's conventional platforms. First generation electric aircraft are heavy, expensive, complicated, and limited in terms of range and payload. In the entire history of aviation, that's never been a winning formula. When everyone already has access to the same batteries, materials, and motors, what really makes the difference? The answer is revolutionary aerodynamics, but in a form factor that suits today's operations and manufacturing. Beyond our own drone product line, we have partners across Aerospace helping incorporate our tech into their products. In the future, if you want to have the most efficient and cost-effective flying machine of any description, you'll need Seaflight's Flow Control inside."

To date our platform has successfully been used to test 12 drugs, and vaccines against 8 different diseases.

A little more detail to understand our scientific approach: A normal cell turns into cancer when it develops a mutation that makes it grow aggressively. Surprisingly, a small number of these mutations account for the vast majority of cancer deaths. The immune system usually doesn’t recognize these mutations, but our technology platform enables us to train the immune system to recognize and attack these cancers. Our first product is a vaccine for the treatment of lung cancer that targets the KRAS mutation, the most common mutation in cancer, accounting for about 30% of all cancer deaths. In the long run, we envision a world where every adult receives our vaccines annually – preventing the majority of cancer deaths. Our team includes some of the leading cancer vaccine experts in the world including: our Chief Scientific Officer, Dr. Liz Jaffee (Chair of President Biden’s Cancer Advisory Panel) and our Chief Medical Officer, Dr. Mark Yarchoan (principal investigator of multiple cancer vaccine clinical trials).

They use synthetic biology to improve these plants’ ability to efficiently and economically extract metals, while remediating land along the way. A tension at the heart of the movement to electrify our cars, homes, and grids is that mining the materials needed is extremely slow and pollutive. As a whole, the mining sector emits 4-7% of global greenhouse gas and generates devastating levels of water and soil contamination. And yet, to meet electrification goals, overall metal output will need to grow by 6x and nickel output will need to grow by 19x. new mine can take up to 15 years just to become operational. Genomines employs genetic editing to enhance the metal-accumulating capabilities of hyperaccumulator plants, organisms with an extraordinary capacity to amass high metal concentrations from soil. By boosting their metal-concentration potential by 10-15 times, Genomines enables these plants to thrive in soils with metal concentrations too low for economic extraction via conventional means. Once harvested, metals are recovered from the biomass using environmentally-friendly techniques such as bioleaching and electrolysis."

gensyn.ai,"Gensyn is building a decentralised machine learning compute protocol that acts as the rails upon which AI models can train on any compute device in the word. As demand for machine intelligence explodes, and machine and human intelligence continue to fuse, we require a world where compute for AI systems is as accessible as oxygen is for humans. This has triggered a scramble for the hardware that enables AI model training – namely, GPUs. AI developers now face a systemic shortage of devices, leading to high prices, poor access, and – ultimately – huge headwinds for AI progress. Gensyn is building a decentralised machine learning compute protocol that acts as the rails upon which AI models can train on any compute device in the word. This provides developers with near limitless access to compute at the fair market price. Gensyn achieves this by building permissionless networking software which schedules ML training across a global array of devices, cryptographically verifies the results, and facilitates payment."

1849.bio,"1849 bio designs microbes enabling cheap metal extraction allowing miners to unlock value from low quality copper and gold ores. Surprisingly, the mining industry is one of the largest scale users of biotech in the world with biomining processes accounting for ~1% of global copper production. Biomining is ultra-low cost, running around ~$1/ton of ore vs ~$7/ton for conventional processes. Unfortunately, while biomining is cheap, it can’t be applied to over 80% of copper ores, leaving vast resources without profitable extraction methods. An estimated ~$800B of copper sit today in waste materials and stockpiles with negative unit economics. While a great deal of effort has been spent on optimizing microbial metal extraction processes, very little effort has been spent on optimizing the microbes themselves. To change that, we’re creating new biotech tools and platforms applied directly to the types of biology most relevant to miners. This enables us to develop new microbes and tackle some of the most difficult problems in biomining, unlocking billions in value from unprofitable resources while being more environmentally friendly than conventional processes. We’re world class microbial engineers. We met while doing our PhDs in synthetic biology, where we spent our time applying and developing the most advanced bioengineering technologies to engineer living cells."

co.uk,"In the global fight against breast cancer, Digistain stands at the forefront, offering a beacon of hope to millions. Our journey began at Imperial College London, where ground-breaking research gave birth to a technology poised to revolutionize breast cancer diagnostics. The Challenge: Every year, breast cancer affects 2.3 million individuals globally. Post-surgery, 60% of patients are advised to undergo genomic testing, an expensive and time-consuming process monopolized by a single lab in the U.S., costing around $4,000 and taking nearly two months. Consequently, only 5% undergo this vital testing. The rest, unable to access this crucial diagnostic step, often resort to chemotherapy—a treatment that, in one in four cases, is more harmful than the cancer itself. Our Solution: Digistain addresses this critical gap. Our technology transforms the current diagnostic process by enabling hospitals to analyze patient samples in-house using existing equipment, supplemented with our innovative technology. This approach offers near-instantaneous decision-making data, a stark contrast to the existing month-long waits. Central to our technology is a proprietary algorithm that identifies a unique spectral fingerprint of the tumour in the infrared spectrum, providing a personalized risk score. This score guides oncologists in selecting the most effective, individualized treatment plans, potentially reducing unnecessary chemotherapy and its harmful side effects. Impact and Potential: Our solution not only challenges the status quo in technology but also in accessibility. In a landmark government-commissioned study, Digistain demonstrated clinical evidence on par with the market leader, but at a fraction of the cost and time. Already making waves in clinical practice globally, with insurance reimbursement at leading cancer centers, our technology represents a paradigm shift in cancer care. Recognized by the Institute of Physics, the Royal Society, and Imperial College for our innovative contributions, and supported by entities like the NHS, Y Combinator, and the European Investment Bank, Digistain is more than a company—it’s a movement towards equitable, effective cancer treatment. With the potential to democratize access to life-saving diagnostics, Digistain is not just envisioning a better future for cancer patients; we are actively creating it."

yuma.ai,"## What is Yuma AI? Yuma is automating customer support by providing an AI Support Agent orchestration platform. Yuma provides autonomous AI agents dedicated to customer service and e-commerce. We integrate directly with help desk software (Zendesk, Kustomer, Gorgias, etc.) and focus on helping large Shopify merchants deal with their high volume of support requests. Top merchants using Yuma can automate up to 60% of their support tickets fully autonomously. ## Why do Shopify merchants need Yuma? There are thousands of large Shopify merchants around the world generating $10M+ a year. Most of them have taken over some niches and are great at what they do: selling their products. But they all have one thing in common: they all hate customer support. It's a burden for them and a huge source of cost, as they receive hundreds of requests per day. Some of them have dozens of support agents on staff, usually offshore, and the overall quality is still often pretty poor while staff turnover remains high. Those merchants have been promised automation for years but have always been disappointed by the outcome. As customers, we have all had to live through a terrible support automation experience before, so this is no secret, and everyone knows that the current state of the technology is quite bad. ## Yuma is solving this in a few ways: Yuma isn't just another RAG chatbot. Our platform provides autonomous AI agents dedicated to support and ecommerce. These agents are powered by knowledge, follow processes, and are managed by our in-house AI orchestration technology. This ensures safety, control, and quality at every step. We believe that to truly automate customer support, we must develop a platform that mimics the actions of a human support agent. That's exactly what we've been doing. Currently, our top merchants are automating 60% of their support tickets through Yuma. Yuma can fetch information from external services and take actions in other apps as needed to resolve each ticket. We are laser-focused on building the best AI support agent platform and aim to achieve 80% true automation in the next few months. ## Fun Fact Yuma got started by accident. This is my third YC startup after Socialcam (W12) and Triplebyte (S15). I released Yuma as a prototype for fun in mid-December 2022 and was overwhelmed with demo requests. That's when I knew I was onto something and had to turn this into a real company, once again."

ezzayo.com,"Tokenomics is at the heart of every crypto ecosystem, and yet validating it can be a difficult, expensive, and uncertain affair. It can take up to 2 years, post launch, to gather enough user data to know if the tokenomics behind an application works or not. This problem exists because the range of options that teams have when testing or validating token economies often leaves them with more questions than answers about the viability of their designs and usually also requires an understanding of code. Ezzayo is a no code, agent-based simulation-driven interactive tool designed to serve as a stress test and validator tool for token based ecosystems. Ezzayo has secured a partnership with Crypto Oasis (also known as CV VC in Europe) who is the due diligence partner for the Dubai government. Crypto Oasis spearheads the Dubai Digital Assets Authority (D2A2), and as such are part of the regulatory framework for the issuances of all blockchain trade licenses in the UAE. Crypto Oasis has a combined European and Middle East portfolio of over 5000 companies. Through the partnership, Ezzayo has access to Crypto Oasis’ client pipeline which strategically positions Ezzayo as the go-to partner for the Dubai crypto ecosystem. They have also finalized an agreement with them to come on board as advisors, along with channel partnerships with Tokenance and iBloxx."

encepheal.com,"EncepHeal is developing medications to treat substance abuse. Our first product is a small molecule therapeutic for stimulants like cocaine and methamphetamine, of which there are no FDA approved treatments. Our small molecule technology are atypical inhibitors of the dopamine transporter. Cocaine itself is an inhibitor of the same transporter. Directly reducing craving or positive reinforcement is a successful treatment strategy for addiction. Methadone or buprenorphine (Suboxone) are key examples of this for opioid use disorder. However, these types of medications can be addictive themselves. This has been a major hurdle for medication development for cocaine addiction and has led to many leaders in the addiction space to abandon the dopamine transporter as a target. At EncepHeal, we believe that the dopamine transporter should not be abandoned and instead focusing on fixing the abuse liability problem. Therefore with our partners at the National Institutes of Health, we have shown that these new, allosteric modulators at the dopamine transporter do not display addictive tendencies in animal models. They are also effective at curbing cocaine addiction. Our management team has two co-founders, Omeed Rahimi and Aaron Lazarus, as well as an experienced addiction pharmacologist as their research officer. The team has an advisory board with entrepreneurial and addiction drug development experience as well as expert partners at the National Institute on Drug Abuse, a subset of the NIH, and Wake Forest. Our team has had success in raising non-dilutive funding and has expertise with SBIR/STTR grants. We are looking for help in better connecting with the biotech/pharmaceutical industry."

Once approved, around summer 22, we will be in a great position to size the $13bn untapped opportunity of +30 Mn uninsured vehicles – just in Mexico! As we will be able to attack the main pain points in the market: i) antiquated underwriting models and ii) payment conditions only adapted for the affluent. To succeed, we have assembled an elite team with both innovative and experienced profiles. We are three cofounders, two ex-McKinsey and one ex-P&G, and we managed to attract two heavyweights of the Mexican insurance industry: the previous CUO of Zurich Mexico and the previous CFO and VP of Finance of ING and AXA Mexico."

leahlabs.com,"LEAH Labs is building living therapies for pets first, and their people next. We're first focused on CAR-T cell therapy for dogs with B cell lymphoma, the naturally occurring clinical analog of human non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. CAR-T cells are curative in humans, and our early results are showing the same - we're inducing remissions in pets with late stage lymphomas. Our virus-free gene editing platform allows us to engineer a dose of CAR-T cell therapy for ~$500, and brings the promise of a curative outcome. Given our safety and efficacy data to date, we believe this product could be used by general practice veterinarians, meaning we have thousands of customers all across the USA who typically treat with palliative care or refer cancer patients to specialty oncologists. Our CAR-T cell platform is regulated by the USDA, not the FDA, affording us a cost effective ""full stack"" to iterate and innovate on CAR-T cell therapy from a hypothesis through clinical validation."

levelninelabs.com,"Level Nine are creating the green molecules of tomorrow. Building on breakthroughs in bio-nanotechnology and quantum chemistry, they are re-imagining enzymes from first principles, developing catalysts with unparalleled performance and control. Thanks to advances in biotechnology, the cost and performance of bio-manufactured products such as plastics and chemicals and their building blocks will soon far surpass oil-derived incumbents, opening up possibilities that are hard to even fathom today, with a market size of 2 trillion USD by 2030. The current biomanufacturing processes are costly and inefficient. And as a result of this, most biomanufacturers still struggle to compete at scale. Advances in enzyme technology have been transformative for biorefinery. These biocatalysts achieve the specificity and activity needed for efficient conversion of biomass into high-value building blocks, opening up whole new possibilities for biomanufacturers. However, enzymes suffer from fundamental limitations which hold back their further adoption: they are prohibitively expensive, single-use, and unstable in harsh conditions. Level Nine are developing the world’s first nanozymes for use in industrial biomanufacturing. Their nanozymes mimic the activity and specificity of natural enzymes, while overcoming their limitations: they are vastly cheaper to produce, can achieve enhanced stability and activity, and are reusable over many production cycles. In short, the next generation catalysts that biomanufacturers need to successfully compete with fossil-derived products at scale."

Currently, it takes billions of dollars to design and develop a new fusion reactor, a hyper-sonic airplane or a new cancer treatment. This is because scientists and engineers have to build very expensive things before they even know if their ideas work. But what if we can simulate the workings of these ideas (and more) on computers first and have high confidence that it works before we build really expensive things? The work of humanity's greatest scientists over the years has given us the physics and math to do this. The problem is that we simply do not have the computing power to solve these big problems. To address this, the Vorticity Inc is re-imagining scientific computing all the way down to processor architecture and system design.

pentabind.com,"PentaBind is an AI drug development company that uses Artificial Intelligence to design aptamer-based drugs. Aptamers are a foundational binding molecule technology used within therapeutics, diagnostics and manufacturing. After decades of research, pharma companies have been able to treat only 15% of the human proteome mostly with small molecule drugs (which represent 90% of drugs on the market). Many proteins are therefore labeled ‘undruggable’, because small molecules can’t treat them. There is a need for advanced therapies to tackle the unmet needs in treating oncologic, neurologic and other diseases. PentaBind’s proprietary AI-based platform designs new aptamer drugs that can target ‘undruggable’ proteins. They apply a powerful Generative AI approach to enable the design of aptamers (short, single-stranded DNA or RNA sequences) with ‘drug-like qualities’, balancing multiple features including binding, specificity, stability and others. PentaBind’s unique competitive advantage lies in their data generation methods, which produce unique, high quality data, now the largest of its kind. Traditional wet-lab aptamer design only optimizes for binding, and only searches 1 billionth of the astronomically large sequence space and so, for the past 20 years, aptamers have been mostly limited to academia."

olive.legal,"Olive uses AI to summarize client medical records for personal injury lawyers. We're at $13k MRR after launching eight weeks ago, and law firms choose us because we double paralegal efficiency. As we take over more legal workflow, Olive will serve victims of medical malpractice directly. Sam's ex-girlfriend introduced him to Greg back at CMU in 2017, and while that relationship didn't last, their friendship has. After undergrad, Greg went to Harvard Law School, while Sam worked for three years at Jane Street, building & leading a satellite dev team. Greg graduated, Sam quit, and we founded Olive with a big idea: use AI to make the law more accessible. We started with AI in corporate law given Greg's background, but quickly realized the space was crowded, and turned our attention to the under-competed $65B personal injury market. AI disruption makes a lot of sense in personal injury because the incentives are aligned—plaintiff lawyers are paid on contingency, and therefore love time-saving tools. We have competitors who have proven substantial demand for medical summaries, but they operate at best on hybrid human/AI approaches with multi-day turnarounds. We think there's space for an AI solution that cuts humans out of the loop entirely, and we think we're the right team to do it. We're focusing on the medical malpractice niche within personal injury, because there's a massive access to justice problem: medical malpractice lawyers decline most cases under $500k since they're too expensive to litigate. An estimated 80% of medical malpractice victims can't secure representation right now. We estimate this latent demand at $48bn/year. We are on a mission to unlock this value."

As a consequence, employers spend huge amounts of time sourcing candidates manually and filtering through irrelevant CVs. Up to 80% of candidates who get invited to an interview, don't even show up. At Hirebolt we eliminate all this work for employers, by finding actively-looking candidates, vetting them and automatically matching them to the best employers using AI.

rewbi.com,"Rewbi uses AI to optimize grid-connected battery storage. We generate revenue by charging when electricity is cheap and discharging when electricity is expensive. We rent battery storage for a fixed fee per month, and we earn 2x that fee in monthly revenue by dispatching the battery optimally. Today, power companies use human traders to manually track grid conditions and update the battery’s dispatch schedule. However batteries can adjust their power output 100x faster than traditional power generation (e.g. hydro, coal, nuclear, gas), with the ability to go from full-speed charging to to full speed discharging in under a minute. Electricity prices change every 5 minutes, often by 300% or more. Our AI better tracks 100s of live inputs, and it makes decisions faster than a human operator (with lower overhead!), improving revenue 2x."

This ""intelligent insulation"" has no wires or sensors, and the fabric's shape-changing behavior comes from a natural materials response. Skyscrape’s fabrics offer expanded thermal comfort across a wider temperature range than conventional clothing. Creating textiles that could change shape with changing temperatures required years of laboratory work by an interdisciplinary team of scientists, engineers, designers, and weavers, designing and refining machines and processes to make yarns and fabrics that could adapt to the environment. Skyscrape's first market entry was with Ralph Lauren in the 2022 Team USA Winter Olympics Opening Ceremony."

These hard-working teams have to deal with communications arriving from too many channels, maze-like processes for fulfilling constituent requests, and a dangerous lack of visibility into constituent opinions on major issues and the work teams perform. Software can help! But the vendor community has responded with hard-to-use, hard-to-implement, and hard-to-purchase private sector software rather than building something from the ground up. These outdated solutions fail to address government workers’ unique challenges. Seneca Systems was founded to address those challenges and strengthen the vital bond between government and people. Our Constituent Services Platform, Romulus, centralizes constituent communications, organizes service requests, and provides insights into constituent preferences and work performed. Built for governments by people who love government workers, Romulus enables government workers to get more done in less time, with less overhead, and to more constituent applause."

HNWI’s can now securely and confidently diversify their portfolios into alternative assets focusing on the luxury market. Arthena has designed and built a statistically rigorous model that estimates the value of artwork over time.

These features include include the artist’s name, medium, date of creation, origin of location and size of work. After identifying groups of work that are similar to each other, we calculate the expected ROI and estimated volatility based on the distribution of gains. Using historical auction results to simulate the performance of our funds, we leverage Monte Carlo analysis to determine annualized returns and sharpe ratios. Based on this analysis, Arthena can validate the financial viability of our product and establish statistically rigorous bounds for these estimates."

laviefoods.comen,"La Vie specializes in the production of plant-based alternatives to traditionally pork-based products such as bacon and ham. La Vie owns a unique patented recipe which reproduces the pleasure of meat without resorting to animals. Intensive animal farming is a huge contributor to climate change: 14.5% of total CO 2 emissions, 27% of land use, and 77 billion animals culled in 2021. Drastically reducing the demand and supply of traditional meat-based protein could have a significant impact on the effects of climate change. But despite the progress of plant-based alternatives as meat substitutes, there was an essential element missing to replicate the taste and culinary experience of meat: fat. It gives meat its characteristic taste, one that’s been sought after for thousands of years. Out of their Parisian laboratory, La Vie’s three years of R&D focused on taste, making it possible to develop a unique recipe that reproduces animal fat with plants. Their technology recreates ‘lean bacon’ without texturing agents before a proprietary process combines it with their plant-based fat technology to give their bacon a signature ‘crispy-yet-juicy’ profile."

These reviews and votes can be cast from the site's iPhone app or from the service's homepage. The homepage also features a stream of the latest comments to come in from other users, as well as a profile for each restaurant in the system that includes all of its votes and comments. There's also a nifty feature that lets you view a heatmap of your current region, so you can quickly figure out the hot spots in town. The gameplay in GraffitiGeo gives you points for checking into certain locations, similar to FourSquare, but doesn't really let you do anything with them. With GraffitiGeo, you earn points for every action you take, be it voting on a restaurant or leaving a brief comment. Once you've reached a certain point threshold, you can use those points to start a ""mob"", which you can invite your friends to join. Mobs allow friends to pool their points, which can then be used to acquire territory, which corresponds to actual city blocks. Whenever someone votes on one of the restaurants on the block, the mob gets some street cred too. It's definitely going to be confusing at first, but it also brings a team element to gameplay."

We take a fixed fee, and the remainder is returned in our Annual Member Dividend. We work with multi-billion dollar capital partners to ensure regulations are followed, adequate claims capital is always available, and we have emergency capacity for catastrophes. Technology allows us to eliminate waste, saving roughly 25% of the cost. We are 100% digital, but not bots - we invest in tech that enables our experts to help Members. As an Invitation Only Membership served by an MGA, **we can give Members Free Insurance** when they invite others, turning our ""Marketing Budget"" into savings for Members. This eliminates Lizards and Sales Agents, saving the other 25%. We do not use the standard industry models, instead using a multiperil model to more granularly price risk. This means that for a few of you we are more expensive... but everyone else pays much less than they would otherwise pay. Our granular, multiperil model allows us to offer a superior policy over the standard market including: - coverage for if your place is flooded by a neighbor - Replacement Cost Coverage (meaning new stuff for your old) - All Risk coverage for high value items you tell us about - including computers (almost no one does that amazingly) - added coverage for mold removal Our MGA business model allows us to be capital efficient, ""renting"" capacity as we need it.

orbio.earth,"Orbio uses satellite imagery to track methane emissions from the oil & gas industry. We sell the data to financial companies that want to invest into the best performing energy companies. Until today, oil & gas companies use excel-based emission factors to calculate and report their emissions. As these excel-based emission factors underestimate actual emissions by ~70%, the finance companies that invest into oil & gas can’t mitigate against incoming risks from new regulations, We have built a technology that can for the first time use satellite images to track methane from every single oil & gas facility on the planet, replacing emission factors and allowing finance companies to make the best bets on oil & gas companies that will withstand a wide avalanche of incoming regulation. In the summer 2023 our satellite-based technology got ranked #1 both in terms of accuracy and sensitivity of methane emission events by Stanford University in a peer-reviewed study, beating a range of multi-bn dollar competitors like Maxar.

Key to Dex is a Chrome extension that enables you to manage relationships while you’re in Facebook, Messenger, Twitter, and the social apps you already use. Dex can also send you actionable reminders (daily, or based on your calendar events) to log your interactions for next time.

talentdrop.com,"When it comes to hiring, there are lots of resources to help managers get more candidates. But on average, only 1 in every 300 of these candidates actually get hired.

Managers are increasingly finding that the simplest and most personable way to attract talent starts with their network. The best candidates want to work for great people, not faceless companies. Sharing open roles on places like LinkedIn, Slack, and Twitter unlocks enormous potential for a personalized recruiting approach across a curated talent pool, but these referrals are difficult to track across platforms and end up lost in the shuffle.

argon-ai.com,"Argon AI is a platform where biopharma and life sciences professionals can execute complex and data driven workflows using natural language. We help professionals get thorough answers to questions about clinical trials, existing treatments, healthcare landscape, and the competitive market in minutes rather than months. Prior to starting Argon, Samy was responsible for Flatiron Health’s (Roche) first data analytics project which eventually led to the start of the Flatiron Services business unit.

He also helped close over $6M+ in ARR and is an expert in enterprise pharma sales. Cyrus previously led engineering teams and built 0 to 1 across pre-seed and unicorn startups, managed mission-critical trade generation systems at Bridgewater, and held AI advisory roles at various startups. Cyrus has a duel degree in EE and CS from USC.

razorpay.com,"The journey of building Razorpay started in 2014, when Harshil Mathur (CEO & Co-Founder) and Shashank Kumar (MD & Co-Founder) witnessed the dismal state of the online payments industry in India then and understood that they have a larger and more important issue to solve. And That was democratizing online payments for Indian businesses, particularly the underserved market, Startups and SMEs. Over the last 9 years, Razorpay has evolved from a single-product company to a multi-product company, from an online payment gateway to India’s only full-stack financial solutions company, offering payments and banking solutions to businesses. Razorpay today is transforming age-old complexities and changing every known paradigm of money movement for disruptive businesses. Over the last couple of years, Razorpay’s growth has evolved to be an index of India’s digital economy. From a kirana shop in Kashmir collecting payments on our POS device to a textile exporter in Kanyakumari accepting dollars through our International Payments product, Razorpay has revolutionised how businesses have traditionally transacted and interacted with money. Razorpay became the first and only Indian fintech to build a full-stack international Payment Gateway ‘Curlec by Razorpay’ and evolved into a comprehensive provider of payment solutions, leveraging the synergy between cutting-edge technological capabilities and a profound understanding of the local payment ecosystem. The introduction of the new Curlec Payment Gateway aims to cater to a wide spectrum of businesses, expanding its reach to over 5,000 establishments. Be it for international expansion or solving for Indian businesses, for Razorpay, the customer has always been at the core of all disruption, from addressing evolving needs to delivering new solutions. This hyperfocus helped bring Razorpay’s several industry-first innovations into the market since 2014. Razorpay became the first to launch a completely digital on-boarding process for startups, first to launch support for UPI, first to launch support for Bharath QR, first to introduce recurring payments for businesses through Razorpay Route, automating payment receipts and later automate payouts and making the entire process seamless and optimized and many more were introduced aling the way. Other firsts include: - First to launch India’s Multi-Network Tokenisation solution, TokenHQ - Razorpay became India’s first payment gateway to support credit cards on UPI - Razorpay also became India’s largest omnichannel payment gateway for businesses post acquiring Ezetap which is India’s leading offline POS company that was founded with the aim to simplify the in-person offline payments experience. Over the years, Razorpay’s valuation has jumped from $1 billion to $7.5 billion and has added a host of marquee investors to its captable. Razorpay is also the second Indian company to be a part of Silicon Valley’s largest tech accelerator, Y Combinator. Marquee investors such as Lone Pine Capital, Alkeon Capital, TCV, GIC, Tiger Global, Sequoia Capital India, Ribbit Capital, Matrix Partners, Salesforce Ventures, Y Combinator, and MasterCard have invested a total of $741.5 Mn through Series A, B, C, D, E and F funding. The last financing round of Series F led the company’s valuation to $7.5 Billion signaling one of the fastest increases in valuation for an Indian Unicorn. Razorpay has also made acquisitions with like-minded companies over the last 9 years. In total, till date, Razorpay has made eight acquisitions, Billme in 2023 - A Digital invoice and customer Engagement, Ezetap in 2022 - India’s leading offline POS company, PoshVine in 2022 - India’s leading loyalty and reward management platform, IZealiant in 2022 - A mobile-first, API-enabled, and cloud-ready payment solution and made its first international foray in South-East Asia by announcing its acquisition of Curlec in 2022 - A recurring payments platform. TeraFin Labs in 2021 - the AI-based SaaS platform that facilitates digital financing solutions, Opfin (Now RazorpayX Payroll) in 2019 - The payroll management solution and Thirdwatch in 2019, the first acquisition - The AI-powered fraud detection platform. All these efforts are being done in collaboration with banks, regulators, and stakeholders so that India can build a better place for small and big businesses. Today, Razorpay powers online payments for 76 Of 100 startup unicorns and millions of businesses in India. The core premise of what Razorpay was founded in 2014 and what it is today hasn’t changed. It is to make money movement simpler and easier, whether it is for businesses to receive money, send money, or manage money."

With Spenny, they just connect the card and invest every time they spend. We're growing 67% WoW since launch, with 3,000+ users and $15,000 in AUM. Indians put $500Bn into their bank accounts annually. We charge 1.75% of the AUM for investments. That's a direct ~$9Bn market in India alone. Potentially every time a user makes a transaction, we make money. And in that sense, the timing for Spenny couldn't have been better: 1 Trillion+ transactions are expected in 2021 because of factors like Whatsapp launching its P2P payments in India for its 400M users. And the emergence of UPI means every Indian has a virtual bank account now. More interesting revenue models develop from the transaction data insights of our users. We analyse the rich data to A) up-sell more financial products like insurance etc., and B) create brand loyalty programs & partnerships. We acquire customers at minimal CAC by bank partnerships.

wyndly.com,"Wyndly (https://www.wyndly.com) fixes allergies by training patients' bodies to ignore their allergy triggers. Frustrated allergy suffers come to us when they no longer want to deal with pills and sprays. We diagnose the patient’s unique allergy profile and create a personalized treatment plan to give the patient lifelong allergy relief. Specifically, Wyndly is increasing access to sublingual immunotherapy (SLIT) for allergy care. For our patients, we're combining the convenience of telehealth and direct-to-consumer care with an exceptional patient experience that never loses the context of care. Wyndly represents an opportunity to change allergy care forever. With 60 million Americans suffering from allergies today, and with this number doubling over the coming years, there's simply an incredible need for the convenient care Wyndly provides. You can read more about us in [Techcrunch](https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/12/wyndly-aims-to-bring-allergy-drops-to-the-masses/). The Wyndly Model At Wyndly, we believe that better connections lead to better care, and we’re committed to making both happen at every step of the patient journey. Our allergy practice allows our patients to work with expert providers to develop personalized treatment plans for long-term allergy relief using clinically proven therapies. From a patient’s initial consultation to their final treatment delivery, we want the Wyndly experience to be a breath of fresh air for allergy sufferers – truly effective allergy relief, simply and efficiently delivered. Once we've conquered allergies, we're transforming the care model for every chronic condition. While transactional care for purchasing pills has flourished in telehealth, no one has gone after chronic care. Patients with chronic conditions are shuffled between providers, insurance, and more -- and they never feel heard. These patients deserve better, and we're going to give it to them. Wyndly is starting with allergies, but we'll expand into asthma, sleep apnea, and other conditions in the near future. Our values **Compassion**: We approach all our patients and partners with an open mind and a genuine desire to be of service. **Focus**: We do a few things very well, and are always clear about our boundaries and direction of travel. **Courage**: We embrace ambiguity and discomfort because we know that’s how we grow. **Progress**: We make something better every single day. *It boils down to empathy and forward momentum in everything we do.* The team Wyndly is proudly backed by Y Combinator and a leading group of angel investors and VCs. The founders are Dr. Manan Shah (Chief Medical Officer), an ear-nose-and-throat surgeon who’s a leading practitioner of telehealth in his specialty, and his cousin Aakash Shah (CEO), who led growth engineering at SparkGift (acquired by Stockpile in 2016) and Parse.ly (acquired by Automattic in 2021)."

lofty.ai,"Lofty is a marketplace that let's anyone sell a house to investors online. Instead of the typical real estate transaction where one seller sells to one buyer, Lofty is much more flexible. Sellers fractionalize their equity ownership in the property into smaller units, so that anyone can buy a portion for as little as $50, allowing access to one of the best asset classes for people who have previously been locked out. Sellers can also sell a portion of their equity (starting at just 10%) instead of the entire property or create customized HELOC structures. Investors can browse a variety of individual real estate properties ranging from commercial strip malls, a HELOC in someone's house, Airbnbs, to a single-family rental properties, and directly purchase ownership in these properties in under 5 minutes. There is no lockup period. Users can constantly trade these ownerships with others on the marketplace. Investors truly legally own the properties they invested in and co-manage it with other investors through an online governance program. Owners have so far voted on how to handle various repairs, delinquent tenants, the sale of the underlying property, and much more. Lofty never custodies or handles user funds or assets. Through smart-contracts on the blockchain, all transactions are directly peer-to-peer.

REGENT has de-risked seaglider technology with a ¼-scale, 400 lb, flying demonstration vehicle and a full-scale wing test section. By 2024, REGENT will fly humans on the first full-scale prototype seaglider. By mid-decade, REGENT’s customers - airlines and ferry companies – will begin commercial seaglider service on the 12-seat initial product. In just two years, REGENT has accumulated $8B in provisional orders (including firm deposits) proving the potential of the $25B+ initial market. REGENT, a team of 40, is led by MIT-trained, ex-Boeing engineers Billy Thalheimer and Mike Klinker. REGENT has raised $50M to date from the likes of Thiel Capital, Founders Fund, Mark Cuban, Y Combinator, and includes strategic investment from Japan Airlines, Hawaiian Airlines and Mesa Airlines."

Guardian Bio’s approach is focused on creating a dendritic cell-based product which drives anti-tumor activity through activating the killers of the immune system AND training them against multiple cancer targets. We take stem cells from cancer patients, turn them into specific therapeutic dendritic cells specially trained against that patient’s tumor, and re-introduce them back into the body. Our therapeutic dendritic cells revitalize the killers of the immune system and give them the kickstart they need to fight - and win - against cancer."

Radiology data, such as CT and X-ray scans, is an incredibly important source of truth in healthcare delivery. In fact, over 90% of all healthcare data is medical imagery! However, the global radiology workforce is overburdened. In the UK, for example, only 2% of radiology departments are able to fulfill their reporting requirements, and this trend is reflected worldwide. The acute state of radiology, coupled with the abundance of data, makes the use of AI in radiology a prime candidate. In 2022, $5.6 billion was invested in the development of AI in healthcare! However, a key hindrance to further adoption is the lack of sophisticated tools to build and deploy AI algorithms in clinical environments. This is the problem we’re focused on at RedBrick AI We're a team based out of Bangalore India, and USA.

At Protex AI, we’re on a mission to protect the industrial workforce! We’re building a proactive computer vision tool for workplace safety - empowering industrial Health and Safety (HS) teams to identify risk and danger before it becomes a problem. 🤕 The Problem: Keeping people safe at work is extremely hard. In the U.S. alone, there were over 5,000 deaths in the workplace in 2019, mainly in the heavy industry space. Serious workplace injuries cost U.S. businesses circa $62 Billion annually. Until now, safety has been reactive, someone has to get injured, and in some cases fatally before something is done about it. ✅ Problem Solved: Protex AI’s platform uses privacy-preserving camera monitoring software to provide companies with an always-on guardian angel, protecting their workforce. The platform plugs into existing CCTV infrastructure and enables HS teams to flexibly translate their document-based safety rules into the real world. Protex AI takes these rules and autonomously audits the customer’s facility to identify areas of high risk and non-compliance. HS teams can access this data via a reporting engine and use it in weekly safety meetings, external safety audits, insurance discussions, and legal claims. The tool integrates seamlessly with existing safety workflows to augment data produced by any manual incident logging system in place."

With the rise in blockchain technology we’re now into a new era of public information sharing, creating a number of challenges for those seeking to harness this new world. Almost all blockchains today are fully transparent. Anyone can read details of each transaction or see when any account makes a transaction. This allows anyone to verify the correctness of the blockchain, but compromises user privacy and constrains the set of possible applications developers can build. Aztec Network is a privacy shield for Ethereum. They enable affordable, private crypto payments and DeFi interactions via zero-knowledge proofs.

TL;DR: If you sell SaaS or B2C subscriptions, we’re here to help you recover lost revenue due to failed payments and involuntary churn. ‘Involuntary’ or ‘Passive’ churn is a hidden Revenue Killer 💳 for Subscription Businesses ❌ THE PROBLEM: Recovering Failed Payments is Complex Involuntary churn refers to the loss of subscribers due to payment failures, not due to them actively canceling. While it is both possible and a worthwhile strategy to attempt to win back a customer during the cancellation process — involuntary churn is not intentional and in most cases, your customers aren’t even aware that their payment failed. 💰 Bottom line? Effective payment optimization does reduce involuntary churn and will increase ARR by as much as 5-10% FLYCODE SOLUTION 💡 FlyCode leverages ML and AI to provide Payment Optimization and smart payment retries to maximize subscription revenue and reduce churn. We apply a unique model tailored to each Merchant and their customers to ensure optimal results. ⚡️Automatically recover failed subscription payments and reduce passive churn ⚡️Use ML & AI based payment optimization to find the best time to charge your customers ⚡️ Improve customer experience by coordinating payment retries with customer emails/SMS 🛠️ We support OOTB + Custom Integrations for Merchants and White-Label for Platforms"

Merchants, service providers and subscriptions-based businesses everywhere now offer their customers the ability to save a debit/credit card on file, so they can pay their bills on time, buy in one click, or earn rewards. In 2021, 79% of consumers worldwide reported already having at least one payment card saved with a service or being open to doing so. In recent years, card-issuing as-a-service has become mainstream: any company can now start their own card business in a matter of weeks. Last year, the number of new payment cards issued was at an all-time high. For users, however, switching banks or opening a new card now comes with an additional hurdle: they need to update their payment info across the internet. On the other side of that equation, card issuers have no visibility or control over the card-on-file updating process, and as a result struggle to get their new users to switch their spend from their old card to the new one, leading to low conversion rates and missed revenue opportunities. Until Sunlight. With our universal get-your-card-on-file API, FIs can now offer their users, at any point in their journey, a quick and easy way to update their debit/credit card info everywhere they shop or pay online, without ever leaving their Apps. The Sunlight API works on every platform that has a card-on-file option (think Uber, Amazon, Netflix, DoorDash, Starbucks and so many more…), is as seamless as a Plaid connection, and always gets the card number and CVV code right on the first try!"

jumpwire.io,"JumpWire is a data protection platform that adds advanced data security controls between APIs, applications and databases. JumpWire automatically identifies sensitive properties inside large data sets and gives developers full control over which people and applications can access or update records containing sensitive info. Examples uses include restricting who can read customer PII to members of the customer service team, giving on-call engineers elevated access to production, or splitting user records between regions for GDPR purposes. JumpWire’s approach to securing data in-place minimizes the risk of data leaks exposing sensitive information or mishandling by other applications and vendors. The exact security scheme applied to data is defined by policies that align with an organization’s existing InfoSec program. JumpWire helps companies who maintain information security with compliance programs such as SOC or HIPAA. They are processing sensitive data, often from their own customers, and exceed security best practices as a competitive advantage. JumpWire provides defense at depth to data and sits alongside access controls and Layer 4 encryption to provide a comprehensive data security solution. JumpWire is unique from solutions such as data vaults by installing inside our customers’ own infrastructure and clouds. It is interoperable with existing applications and databases, which eliminates the need for large data migrations or code refactoring. Lower-level approaches to data security, such as encryption at rest, are too blunt and lack the ability to differentiate between properties in the data itself. Its scope is limited to physical storage, and security is lost as soon as an application or query loads the data."

finosu.com,"Hi - Mark and Gab here! We met while working at Alt, a marketplace for collectibles, within which we built a $200m specialty finance business line. At Alt, we were faced with the manual workflows from compliance to servicing that are needed to make and manage consumer loans. And as a result, we spent much of our time and hundreds of thousands of dollars creating robust internal tooling to ensure we were doing things the right way. However, after the pain of hunting through regulatory codes, confusion of form filling, surprise of regulatory deadlines, monotony of PDF data extraction, anxiety of brittle excel spreadsheets, the frustration of buried email threads with advisors, and the missed phone calls with borrowers to chase payments … to name a few … we knew that this experience needed to be improved. So, we started Finosu to build the tools that we wish we had. Finsou is building software to reduce the barriers to entry in lending, beginning with: outsourced state licensing, default compliant loan management systems, and automated servicing infrastructure. The operational cost of originating and servicing loans reaches into the tens of billions a year and that is money out of the pocket of lenders, borrowers, investors, and ultimately the consumers as a cost of doing business – we are changing that."

Our initial target market is sorority girls who can have up to 3-4 events per week that they need a new outfit/dress for. One of our core theses is that this idea couldn’t have existed at scale until now because resale apps like Depop & Poshmark paved the way for a P2P model to work after familiarizing users with the process of taking pictures of items, shipping, etc. Advantages to our P2P model - Entrepreneur-led - Similar to Depop, most of our growth will be spearheaded by a group of “top renters” - More variety in inventory - Existing rental companies like Rent the Runway own all the inventory so they're limited to the brands they buy/partner with. Since we're P2P, our users can rent any item or brand that's in someone else's closet - Better margins - we don’t touch any inventory or deal with the cleaning of any items - Unlike Rent the Runway, we don’t handle any inventory or the cleaning of items.

velsa.de,"Velsa is rethinking the way startups and SMEs discover legal challenges and select lawyers. Currently, this process happens in a time-consuming and inefficient way. This is due to startups and SMEs detecting legal problems not at all or way too late, and therefore assigning legal work in a manual, last-minute fashion. In Europe alone, startups and SMEs spend over €64.5bn per year on legal services this way. Velsa brings the power of data to managing legal matters. They currently have 32+ startups from Berlin, London and Paris solving their legal challenges with their MVP. Velsa’s MVP translates business actions and product features into legal roadmaps to generate data on legal steps, requirements, costs and timelines. Based on this data, Velsa matches the request with the right lawyer(s). Their MVP can save businesses millions in losses and opportunity costs that undetected legal challenges or a mediocre lawyer causes them today."

mindely.ai,"Mindely is the first AI interviewer designed for skills assessment interviews. Hiring for high volume, high turnover roles (e.g., consultants, analysts, sales & customer representatives) is time-consuming, inconsistent, and prone to unconscious bias. Managers spend valuable time on lengthy skill-based interviews instead of focusing on building candidate relationships or on driving company revenue. Traditional AI interviewers don’t solve these issues – their rigid Q&A formats and one-size-fits-all approach can’t handle complex skill assessments. Mindely changes the game as the first AI interviewer built for in-depth case study, technical and role-play interviews. It: - Simulates human interaction with real-time dialogue - Challenges candidates with dynamic, adaptive responses - Eliminates interviewer bias to create a fair, inclusive hiring process - Works 24/7 to free up senior staff and widen talent pool With Mindely, companies can rapidly customize and deploy human interviews at AI scale to test specific on-the-job skills."

We got obsessed with identifying how we can help small business owners run their business and have a life.

Today the suite includes apps like: • Go links: Go links allows anyone in the org to easily name any link so team members can jump directly to the information that matters most: go/sales, go/production, go/anything-you-want. • Profiles with Personality: OrgOrg profiles are as insightful as they are delightful. They not only show you the expected org chart data, but also highlight accomplishments, how you like to work, and who you are as a person. • Goal tracking: Track, share, and collaborate on ""big rock"" goals on the cadence that makes sense for your team from daily to annually. • Branded New Tab: Keep the team focused the next major milestone, broadcast announcements, and keep important links top of mind every time a new browser tab is opened. • All Hands Q&A: Crowdsource questions, anonymously if desired, for large team meetings to make sure everyone's voice is heard, and the most top of mind questions are answered and recorded. • Smart Groups: Create rules based groups of people and use them to make sure the right people are in the right conversations and have the right access. For example, anyone with the title of ""Software Engineer"" should be in the #eng slack channel and eng@ google group. • On-call: Schedule smart rotations that take into account balancing the load and using signals from calendar schedules to make sure you don't waste time figuring out who can cover what in a fair way. Easily page the on-call from slack, API, or OrgOrg directly. • And more... All the tools you need so you can spend more time focusing on your core business, and less time focusing on the complexity that comes from running an organization."

Qantev provides AI-powered solutions to health and life insurers, automating claims management, reducing fraud, and optimizing provider networks.

Polyester alone makes up 60% of the $2.5 trillion fashion industry and is the biggest blocker preventing brands from meeting sustainability mandates. The patent-pending ALT TEX fermentation technology creates a polyester alternative that works with the existing infrastructure to supply a sustainable, high performance and cost competitive polyester replacement to fashion brands, at scale. The product solves key problems for fashion brands, consumers, and the environment: (1) Fashion brands: ALT TEX sells fabric to fashion brands, allowing them to differentiate via sustainable options (sustainable fashion growing 11% CAGR) and hit sustainability targets, without sacrificing performance or changing their current supply chain. (2) Consumer: The ALT TEX fabric is projected to be half the price vs. other specialized sustainable alternatives (due to low-cost input and scalability), meaning greater accessibility. (3) Environment: A single shirt produced with ALT TEX fabric can divert 1 kg of food waste from landfills, 9 kg of carbon emissions from the air, and 4 g of micro-plastics from our waterways. Co-founders Myra and Avneet have worked together managing teams and projects for six years, with backgrounds in serial entrepreneurship, corporate sales at Fortune 500 companies, textile manufacturing and biochemistry. To date, ALT TEX has created their first fabric prototype that’s 70% stronger than cotton, secured $1M in LOIs and raised $2.3M."

Low levels of digitization throughout the industry have created massive inefficiencies, contributing to safety issues, errors, and wasted resources. Converge optimizes concrete operations.

gullak.money,"Gullak is a mobile app that automates savings & invests these in Gold. We launched in India 60 days ago and have grown from 0 to 40k transacting users and hit a monthly GTV of $280K already. We are growing 25% week on week. India is a nation of savers but the way the majority of India saves is non-smart & does not create wealth. There are 200 Mn Indians who save manually in bank deposits, the returns from these instruments do not even beat India's inflation. Gold is an instrument that India loves - 30Bn worth gold is purchased in India every year by middle income households. Gold has great cultural significance in India & there is high familiarity with the asset class. Despite gold being a familiar asset class & giving 5% higher returns than bank deposits, 200 Mn Indians still save manually in these non wealth creating bank deposits. This is largely because the ways to save in Gold required painful discrete activities such as manually accumulating money to buy gold, going to offline stores to buy this gold, incurring storage charges & more. The minimum ticket size for purchasing gold at these stores is $50 adding to more friction to saving in Gold. Using automated savings, Gullak now makes it extremely easy for users to save small amounts regularly($1/day) in digital Gold.This was not possible a year ago because the underlying infrastructure(UPI Autopay) was missing. With 50 Mn Indians saving $2/day & with gold backed lending, this is a $1.5Bn market opportunity. Gullak’s Founding team is the team which built BHIM UPI App(10Mn Downloads in 10 Days), this was launched by the PM of India. We built large scale payment systems for partners like GooglePay / Amazon, processing more than 30Mn payments/day. This is the same team that has built more than 40+ consumer brands & their initial growth strategy."

We sell tools to software builders and buyers to help them make their software better for users. We call this as our User Assistance Platform, and it comes in 2 pieces: - AI Agent — an AI chat agent that can answer users questions, perform actions for them, and even co-browse with them to teach your interface. - Nudge Platform — AI-assisted nudges, hints, and messages to guide users in personalized ways that don’t annoy them. We do this by optimally delivering nudges based on in-product behavior not just static rules as well as measuring measuring and the extent to which users “rage close” nudges to avoid pestering them. A replacement for legacy Digital Adoption Platforms User assistance translates into concrete outcomes like improved engagement, feature adoption, conversion, and retention, all while decreasing low-value support tickets.

On the other hand, SMBs represent 44% of the US GDP and are historically forced to deal with high freight rates and friction due to their small size compared to enterprise businesses. With trucking being a hyper-fragmented market (90%+ of US trucking companies are small family businesses), we decided to build an ecosystem that takes all of this inefficiency and turns it into something that could fundamentally transform the livelihoods of businesses and drivers alike. Oway is designed to be simple (you can place an order in 30 seconds) and scale with your business.

By syncing with local payment networks, Moreta lets you pay like a local—securely and digitally—without needing a bank account in every country.

Moreta will target 67 million travelers arriving in the region each year, who together have $127 billion in everyday expenditure."

airthium.com,"We build engines that have the potential to slash 33% or worldwide CO2 emissions - cost-effectively. First, we help food and mining companies cut both their heat costs *and* CO2 emissions by replacing gas-fired steam boilers with our proprietary high temperature heat pumps. Our heat pumps make up to 3x more heat with the same amount of electricity, even at up to 1000°F. Once the heat pump market is mature, we will address the seasonal energy storage market. Our storage units are based on the exact same proprietary engine we use for our heat pumps. They work with solar and wind, and replace lithium-ion batteries, fossil-fired power plants, CO2 capture and storage, and fuel procurement, with a cheaper, sustainable and more reliable alternative, which can be sited anywhere. The first opportunity is a high-margin market worth 3% of worldwide CO2. The second is a much bigger market worth 30% of worldwide CO2. By the time all cars become electric, it will be even more. Our key is we are building the first Stirling engine to reach 86% of the Carnot efficiency, compared to 64% for the state of the art. We do all that while significantly decreasing costs, and increasing reliability. Please see Airthium's website for more information."

The process is currently entirely manual and takes an average of 400 hours over 18 months. Adria eventually burned out and resigned, which is when she realized that bereavement costs businesses $100 billion annually in lost productivity, absenteeism, and attrition. By addressing this problem through businesses, Elayne generates recurring revenue in an industry traditionally reliant on 1x transactions, while maintaining a lasting presence in the end user’s life.

The pandemic spurred interest among new investors, and our AUM has grown 3x since April 2020. And we’ve done this with a cost of acquisition that is 10% of the industry average. Here’s the problem we see. Only 10% of the 100 million middle-income Indian workers have invested in the markets. This is despite the fact that they save ~30% of their income, making this a $325B potential market in assets under management. However, current investment apps in India are built for active investors. With over 16,000+ mutual funds and 5000+ stocks to choose from, they are far too complicated for beginners, who make up most of the market. We’re building an AI - driven investment planning software that is designed for beginners. Users use our conversational AI to get diversified mutual fund portfolios tailored to their goals.

This results in providers spending $300 Billion a year to get paid, and ultimately collect less money than what they are owed. CoreCare aggregates administrative patient data from all systems providers work with (EHR, Gov, Payer), standardizes it in our Enterprise Data Warehouse and creates a single net view of administrative patient data for the provider. Then we add workflow automations (according to client specifications) to eliminate the manual work providers are forced to do to get paid."

We connect to smart thermostats, HVAC systems, batteries and EV chargers to automatically lower consumption during peak times. Electrification is at the core of the UK’s net zero strategy. However, with the increase of renewable energy as a mix of the electricity supply, comes an intermittent and more volatile balance between supply and demand. With the mass adoption of EVs, the increasingly urgent demand for air conditioning and electrification of heat, overall electricity demand is outpacing the transformation of the grid. Elyos Energy is helping to solve the problem of supply and demand with energy flexibility at scale, starting with the 1.6 million commercial buildings in the UK. Our SaaS platform enables large commercial buildings to leverage their distributed energy resources (smart thermostats, HVAC systems, solar, battery) to reduce strain on the grid at hours of peak demand and lower their energy costs. We connect to a range of APIs from smart thermostats, HVAC systems, solar, battery etc. to automate measures of energy consumption reduction and opt-in to national grid demand response events where customers can earn money for energy reduction. By shifting 10% of peak time consumption, we save companies 15% on their electricity bill and reduce their CO2 emissions by 7%. Elyos Energy is leveraging energy flexibility, at mass-market scale to enable electrification of the energy system."

medpay.in,"MedPay Connected Care Network (CCN) of clinics, pharmacies and diagnostic centers enables healthcare centers to accept insurance payments in real-time and facilitates a cashless claims process for the insured. The outpatient market in India is highly unorganized and fragmented. Out of the US$370 billion overall healthcare spend, 70% is on outpatient services. However, insurers and B2C digital health companies are unable to access this market. Part of the reason for this is India’s low health insurance adoption, which is partly due to the lack of an organized and large primary healthcare (PHC) network. MedPay links primary healthcare centers to a cashless OPD (Outpatient Department) insurance network, expanding their reach and allowing them to provide a seamless, cashless experience to their customers."
