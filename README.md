# Task AI Engineer

## Description

You are working as an AI engineer at Hostinger company. During the retrospective
meeting of a product team, you heard that our domain tool is lacking a domain
suggestion feature compared to market competitors. Competitors have a feature
where domain names are suggested by the user-provided business description. You
decided to conduct research and build a few proofs of concepts on how such a
feature might be implemented.

You decided to test out a few possible solutions to a problem:

1. Evaluate prompt engineering techniques.
2. Create a small dataset and evaluate the fine-tuning approach with open-source
   LLMs.

After the experiments, you decided to:

1. Write an API for the domains team to test one of your experiments (prompt
   engineering or fine-tuning).
2. Prepare a document with your findings and experiments results.
3. Write suggestions for the domains team on how to move further with feature
   implementation.

## Constraints of a task:

1. Write code in Python programming language.
2. All your experiments should be documented in a Notebook.
3. Experiments should be reproducible, and fine-tuned models should be available
   for download.
4. Bonus if you could deply the fine-tuned model.
